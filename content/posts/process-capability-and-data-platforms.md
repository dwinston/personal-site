Organizational capabilities can be divided into
 three categories: resources, processes, and priorities.
Resources are *what* you use to achieve an outcome,
processes are *how* you achieve it, and priorities are *why*.
Understanding capabilities in this way can aid in strategy
not only across
a large organization but also within units, and even for individuals.[^Christensen]

Resources are tangible assets. Resources that you use and consult as part of intended
 processes, and to communicate intended priorities, are neither the processes
 nor the priorities themselves.
 
 If you outsource all or part of a process,
 you erode in-house process capability.
 You still get secondary output resources from primary input resources via these
 outsourced processes, and
 downstream in-house processes are unaffected. You might eventually find yourself 
 sailing as Theseus -- you continue to have and produce the resources you
 need, so it's still the same ship, right?

As part of a deliberate short-term strategy, it can be a good idea to outsource
a process,
or, equivalently, a component of it. Your plan has been
validated, and you're focused on growth. However, if you don't know enough
to set a deliberate strategy, then yours may be an emergent strategy, impatient
on validation and patient on growth. Validation is about checking assumptions
as part of any prediction or forecasting: what must be true for this to work?
It might not be a good idea to outsource processes key to validating an
emergent strategy.

For data-intensive research,
commercial informatics platforms can mitigate the
need to develop or maintain in-house process capabilities,
for which ongoing professional
development/training is crucial. However, this means that the manner in which you
derive insight from internal data resources may be intimately tied to the
capabilities -- the resources, processes, and priorities -- of another organization.
