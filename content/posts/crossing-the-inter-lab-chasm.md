> Without enduring self-ideals, our [research] would lack coherence. As individuals, we'd never be able to trust ourselves to carry out our [protocols]. In a social group, no one person would be able to trust the others. A working society must evolve mechanisms that stabilize ideals -- and many of the social principles that each of us regards as personal are really "long-term memories" in which our cultures store what they have learned across the centuries.

Your electronic lab notebook (ELN) and/or laboratory[^1] information management system (LIMS)[^2] embodies ideals in various implicit or explicit forms: data formats and validators, software transformation functions and tests, planning/recording/reporting document templates, etc.

Are these ideals siloed in your ELN/LIMS, or are they shared? If so, how, and is sharing robust?

[^1]: whether "controlled physical / wet", "field", or "computer" laboratory

[^2]: and you do have one, whether personal (and perhaps embarrassing), project-wide, lab-group-wide, institute-wide, etc.
