How do FAIR data resources work? How can you build a FAIR resource from many little parts, each
non-FAIR by itself?

Minsky's *The Society of Mind* tries to explain how minds can work, how intelligence can emerge from
non-intelligence, how you can build a mind from many little mindless parts.

In the "society of mind" scheme, a mind is made of many smaller *agents*. Each agent plays a simple
role that needs no mind at all. When we join enough of them, we get "mind".

In a FAIR "mind" (e.g. a research knowledge management system), each connected resource -
plans/protocols, recorded observations, information products (tables/figures/plots), assigned
metadata/tags, validation/review artifacts, integration/analysis code, publication/distribution
assets, data schemas / controlled vocabularies, archives -- may also play a simple role that needs
no "FAIRification" at all. When we join enough of them in principled ways, we get "FAIR".

> It's much the same for shattered pots as for the cogs of great machines. Until you've seen some of
the rest, you can't make sense of any part.

Each part may have lots of cross-connections. It's not clear that the parts may be arranged so that
we can climb "straight to the top" together, by mental stair-steps, one by one. The parts are
tangled in a Web. Let's begin.
