How could solid-seeming computer hardware support such a ghostly thing as research progress? The
world of scientific inquiry and the world of bits appear too far apart to interact in any way.

A few centuries ago it seemed impossible to explain Life - living things appeared to be so different
from anything else. Last century, von Neumann helped show how cell-machines could reproduce. Watson
and Crick helped show how cells make copies of their hereditary code.

How does scientific process work? GÃ¶del and Turing helped reveal the range of what machines could be
made to do. McCulloch and Pitts in the 1940s began to show how machines might be made to see,
reason, and remember.

We are still far from being able to create machines that do all of the scientific work that people
do. But we also need better theories about how knowledge is acquired and applied, how data is
interpreted, etc. Tiny machines, "agents", could be "particles" helpful in constructing such
theories and operationalizing them.
