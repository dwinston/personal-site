Sharing is a way to facilitate concurrency. Collaboration is a way to orchestrate concurrent operations on what is
shared.

In this sense, the problem of data sharing and collaboration is an in-the-large version of the
in-your-programming-language-and-runtime problem of shared memory and concurrent processes/threads. Just like the
subsystems of a larger software solution should consider eschewing local data-management parochialisms in favor of the
[language of the system](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/LanguageSystem.md), so
should scientific researchers consider the impact of their parochial decisions about data structure on the potential for
sharing and collaboration.

Data collaboration is operations collaboration -- joining the results of operations on shared data to achieve desired
outcomes using the union of capital resources from both organizations. The facilitation of data sharing is not enough --
you can build a filing cabinet, but it may remain empty.
