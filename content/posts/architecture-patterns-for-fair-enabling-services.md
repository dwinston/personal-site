I've been trying to grok architecture patterns as presented by Percival and Gregory[^patterns] to
support domain-driven design and event-driven microservices with Python. I hope you find the diagram below useful.

A microservices approach seems apt for FAIR-enabling services that need to be composed, flexibly,
for any given research artifact's digital lifecycle. Consider these services:

- minter[^arklet] (F)[^FAIR]
- binder[^arklet] (F)[^FAIR]
- resolver[^arklet] (F)[^FAIR]
- index[^index] (F)[^FAIR]
- object store[^objectstore] (A)[^FAIR]
- transactor[^transactor] (I)[^FAIR]
- harmonizer[^harmonizer] (I)[^FAIR]
- tracker[^tracker] (R)[^FAIR]

Consider how you may want to swap one technology choice for a given FAIR-enabling service with
another choice, at any time, as part of evolving FAIR infrastructure to which you connect in order
to collaborate on and publish / share research artifacts.
