Good identifiers are opaque, so translation is by association --
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs">owl:sameAs</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#exactMatch">skos:exactMatch</a>,
or some other relationship.
Translation doesn't follow from reading a sign, but from retrieving a sense.

If metadata is relationships between identifiers,[^bide] then metadata is the medium of conceptual convergence.
