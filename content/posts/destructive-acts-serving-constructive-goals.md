Let's say that the urges of the *Play* process compete with those of other processes, like *Sleep*:

If *Sleep* wrests control, then perhaps a *Wrecker*-process urge, previously constrained and now freed from *Play*'s constraint, need only persist for one more kick to gain the satisfaction of a final crash:

This destructiveness may seem senseless, but it may serve to communicate frustration at the loss of a goal, and to serve constructive goals by leaving fewer problems to be solved -- the kick may leave a mess "outside", yet it may tidy the process orchestration.

It isn't true that when *Sleep* starts, *Play* must quit and all its agents have to cease. A mind can "go to bed, yet still build towers in its head."
