[Yesterday](https://donnywinston.com/posts/fair-enabling-services/), I proposed that a strategy for
implementing the [FAIR principles](https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/FAIR) for research data
management can focus on ensuring five FAIR-enabling _services_, which in turn will prompt tactical
choices of [FAIR-enabling resources](https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FAIR-Enabling-Resource) that
may satisfactorily address each [question](https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Question) and thereby
produce a comprehensive [implementation profile](https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology). The
purpose of such care in design is to de-risk one's investment in "going FAIR", as the cost of
systems implementation and maintenance can easily exceed the cost of a design phase by an order of
magnitude.

These FAIR-enabling services are, again:

1. Identifying
2. Validating
3. Indexing
4. Translating
5. Tracing

Other than cursory remarks, I am yet to elaborate in any detail the behavior I expect from these
services. I would like to remedy this over the next five weeks, one week per service, in the order
given above.

And there is a constraint I would like to impose on myself: each week will be a five-day progression
of notes that reflects the service sequence above. For example, during the first week (on
Identifying), I will:

- On Day 1: Identify the concepts, attributes, and relationships at play in Identifying.

- On Day 2: Assert and validate a set of statements, using elements that I identified the day
  before, that should hold for Identifying.

- On Day 3: Demonstrate a process of Indexing the above in order to efficiently retrieve
  assertions.

- On Day 4: Assert relationships among schemes for Identifying, and attempt Translating from one to
  another.

- On Day 5: Demonstrate a process of Tracing revisions made to the metadata that Identifying
  yields (i.e., what is returned when an identifier is resolved).

Is this five-week planned experiment ambitious? Yes? Is it _too_ ambitious? Almost certainly yes.
Will I attempt it anyway? Yes.

Would I appreciate your day-to-day feedback for course correction? Yes. And I would enthusiastically
acknowledge your contribution when collecting and clarifying the sum of each week's notes.
