To validate is to compute, so indexing metadata for past validation events and caching any
detailed payloads can save time and effort.

Why index? To search. Why search? To find relevant ("likely valid"), ranked ("more likely valid")
results.

One may think of validation events as akin to GitHub stars, but with semantics: semantic stars, in
that one can filter by validation types and/or validation agents that you trust, by recency if
applicable, etc.

Crucially, the qualified nature (i.e., <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I3">fair:I3</a>) of starring may help a community of practice mind the
cautionary tale of The Sneeches.
