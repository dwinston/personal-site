Can you even de-member and re-member (like with key-value pairs) the message?

Okay, now can you even handle (like with a handler function) the message?

Okay, now can you even commit (like with a database) to act on / respond to the message?

Validation levels[^1]:
- Syntactic: Grammatical. About the structure. Subject verb object? Fine.
- Semantic: Ontological. About the meaningfulness. Subject is a type of thing you know can verb? Object is a type of thing you know can be verbed? Fine.
- Pragmatic: Epistemological. About the context. You know that you can commit to make subject verb object right now in this environment? You can (and ideally do!) distinguish "Subject verb object" as a justified belief and not merely _something given_ (Latin meaning of _datum_)? Fine.
