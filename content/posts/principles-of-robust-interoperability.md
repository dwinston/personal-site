I have been ruminating on core values in service of stewardship of evolving scientific knowledge.

Specifically, what principles can I lean upon to guide me in the design of robustly interoperable
digital objects?

Here is what has jelled so far for me:

1. [Machine Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))

   - rectifies and amplifies formal modeling

   - facilitates machine action

   - requires that both bits and semantics are accessible

2. [Least Power](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower-2006-01-23.html)

   - constrained interpretation promotes interoperability

   - lower barrier to support diverse and unanticipated use cases

   - behavior is more likely to be understood and predicted with high confidence

3. [Stationary Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary-action_principle)

   - small deviations from intended sequence-of-processes (i.e. task path) does not require large compensating efforts to reach intended outcome.

   - emphases monotonicity, smooth steering, and suitable granularity of progress.

   - emphasizes resilience of desired budget over desired schedule rather than minimization of initial budget over initial schedule.
   
4. [Logic + Control](https://doi.org/10.1145/359131.359136)

   - facilitates declarative programming

   - facilitates flexibility in choices of performance tradeoffs

   - promotes reuse

5. [Delta Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding)

   - facilitates provenance

   - facilitates revision control

   - facilitates pub/sub for selective search and retrieval
