Some energy infrastructure emits carbon. Some data infrastructure emits complexity.

There is essential carbon emission, like humans exhaling CO<sub>2</sub>. And there is incidental,
non-essential carbon emission, like humans burning fossil fuels.

There is essential complexity in data (and software code), like that pertaining to modeling your
subject matter and your application domain. And there is incidental complexity -- "incidental is
Latin for *your fault*." [^simplemadeeasy].

How can we eliminate incidental carbon emissions from energy infrastructure? Electrify everything.[^electrify]

How can we eliminate incidental complexity emissions from data infrastructure? Triplify everything.[^rdf]
