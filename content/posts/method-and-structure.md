Arrangements of bits have structure just like arrangements of atoms have structure. Interoperability
is about aligning structure. Processing, properties, performance -- if their characterization can be
repeated, they have information structure.

> All structure is created by a process. Any process that can be repeated is a method. Every
method—indeed, every process—<em>itself</em> has a structure.[^1]
