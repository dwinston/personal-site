Don't archive you assets[^wpdam] — frontier them.
Research is a living process.[^rdaf]
Even when a research project is "finished", is it really?

ResearchEquals[^r=] clearly articulates the idea of asset-story[^coriseds] continuations[^wpcont].
Choose your own adventure -- what downstream assets[^dagstersda] may use the current "leaf node"[^wpt]?

Your digital research assets are outputs in some stories and inputs in others.
Some of these stories are yet to be told — even stories where an asset is an output.
Imagine the serendipity of a future research project producing a digital asset with the same SHA256 hash[^wpsha2] as a previously registered asset.

With FAIR[^fair] stewardship, every digital research object is a frontier asset, with outbound PID-graph[^pidgraph] edges waiting to be claimed[^rdfclaim].
