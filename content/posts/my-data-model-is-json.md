"My data model is JSON". JSON is not a data model. JSON has no semantics in the context of
information systems; JSON defines neither how data "behaves" nor how machines can compute with it.

"My data is just JSON". Your data is never just JSON; you always impose external semantics.

"JSON is easy to understand". What does the field `"harrastukset"` mean? In an example JSON
document, its value is `["valokuvaus", "pienoismallit"]`. Oh, you don't know Finnish?[^1]
