What globally unique, persistent, resolvable identifiers do you use for datasets?
I want to know about either (a) a challenge you're facing, and what you've tried; or (2) a choice you recently made, and how it's going.

Context: For each question of the [FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) Ontology](https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology), I want to collect and discuss folks' choices and challenges on my podcast, [Machine-Centric Science](https://podcast.polyneme.xyz/).

Please email me at [podcast@polyneme.xyz](mailto:podcast@polyneme.xyz) with:
* an email _subject_ of either (a) "FIP F1-D challenge" or (b) "FIP F1-D choice",
* (preferred) an email _attachment_ of a one-minute-max audio recording so that you can asynchronously mini-guest on the podcast ðŸ™‚,
* an email _body_ that at minimum says either (a) "[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)" or (b) "[CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) ...", where "..." is how you wish to be attributed (e.g. your name, your name and location, your name and affiliation, etc.).

You may also write out your challenge or choice in the email body, in which case I will read it
aloud. If you choose a CC0 license, I will by default keep you anonymous unless you give me attribution info.

Extra credit:
* Use an [Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCiD)](https://orcid.org/) for your attribution info. Obtaining one is free.
* If applicable, give me an [ANZSRC-2020-FoR code](https://vocabs.ardc.edu.au/viewById/316#browse-tree) (the browsable tree takes a second or two to load) for your typical field of research, whether two-digit (most broad), four-digit (narrower), or six-digit (narrowest in this scheme).

If you really want to send me multiple choices and/or challenges, please send them as separate emails. Also, feel free to spread this message far and wide. Thanks!
