The "one platform[^platform] to rule them all" is unlikely to be realized for scientific research in
any domain. Rather, instead of small and numerous on-premises silos for data + code + compute, we
are on track to achieve large and somewhat less numerous cloud-based silos.[^sheffield]

What's the alternative? A focus on microservices -- so-called to emphasize that they generally do
not stand alone, but rather are components of larger workflows/services -- such as data-slicing and
data-summary-layer services that allow you to bring big data to code+compute by effectively
subsetting/streaming it.[^sheffield]

But how? One approach is to pursue domain-driven design that is devoid of architecture/orchestration
concerns but that yields domain events, wrapped by event-driven microservices that deal with
specific technology choices, wrapped finally by entrypoint interfaces driven by user/user-agent
personas and their use cases.[^patterns]
