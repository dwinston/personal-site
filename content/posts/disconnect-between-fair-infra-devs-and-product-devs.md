Rory Macneil nails it:[^1]

> This seems to me to be a really important  problem. In my experience a lot of the discussion about
things like PIDs and controlled vocabularies seems to assume that these things just exist. But when
you actually go to try to use them and make them usable  in the context of tools that people use in
research,  that presents a whole additional series of challenges;  I think oftentimes  those
challenges are overlooked or ignored or not even thought about  by people who are doing work in PIDs
and controlled vocabularies.
