Some queries can be optimized; others can't. This is due to the structure of the
query itself, which in turn is due to the structure of the underlying data. "Sargable" is
database-speak for *Search ARGument ABLE*.[^1] A query is sargable if it *can* be optimized,
e.g. by creating and using an index. It's a good idea to write sargable queries.

This is what FAIR[^fair] is all about: making results actionable for query planning
and optimization, both for your future self, your collaborators, and for any automated agents
you might wish to deploy to facilitate discovery.
