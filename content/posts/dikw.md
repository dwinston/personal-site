The DIKW[^1] decomposition expresses a layering of context on top of raw observations.

Data points are attributes -- components of facts. They are actuals (e.g., measured numbers) that
can be connected to contexts.

Information is data tied to context, i.e. processed data ("history") that reduces uncertainty wrt
what, when, where, and who. Information connects attributes to compute entities -- flocks of
attributes that are *in formation*.

Knowledge is information tied to goals, i.e. actionable information ("know-how") that
reduces uncertainty wrt how. Knowledge connects entities to compute evaluations (e.g., which
entities are most suitable for which goals?).

Wisdom is knowledge tied to action, i.e. applied knowledge that reduces uncertainty wrt why. Wisdom
connects evaluations to compute decisions.

Data and information look to the past - information is data plus observed contexts. Knowledge and
wisdom look to now and the future - knowledge is information plus goal contexts, and wisdom is
knowledge plus action.
