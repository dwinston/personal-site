I think of a community as a ***state*** (-ity) of ***having a purpose in mind*** (mmun->mean) ***together*** (co-), not as an endurable space.
I think of a forum as an endurable space, as a doored (from the Latin *fores*, i.e. door) space of focus (from the French *foyer*).

How many makes a community?
I don't know.
I won't pretend the Hebrew *minyan* actually shares etymology with community, but it does helpfully suggest a quorum of ten.
How many is too many?
Because a community is a purpose-coherent social state, Dunbar's number suggests a "knee of the curve" of roughly 150.

It seems hard for a set of people to sustain a state of having a purpose in mind together.
If the purpose can be fulfilled, then if it is, that set of people can attempt to self-herd themselves to an adjacent or follow-on purpose, and thereby "evolve" "the" community into a different community, a different state of having a purpose in mind together.

A forum can serve a community.
If that community evolves, i.e. shifts coherence of purpose, the forum may be sustained if both the pre-shift and post-shift purposes benefit from similar-enough kinds of focus.

It seems that a forum sometimes is made to endure despite the dissolution of the community that motivated its origination as a shelter for focus.
I can't help but think of the chartered corporation as typically being such a forum.
The first such charters were granted to incorporate a set of people to sustain, via a shelter for focus, a state of having a purpose in mind together of constructing a particular railroad.
