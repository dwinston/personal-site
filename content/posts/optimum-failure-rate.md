Not documenting failures causes them to be repeated. This repetition is waste because no new
information is generated. Only *new* failures generate information.

There is an optimum failure rate.[^reinertsen] We can avoid oversimplifications like "embrace
failures" or "avoid failures". We maximize information gain by making outcomes equally likely. Thus,
for a test with two outcomes, seek a 50% failure rate. This is information-theoretic support for the
binary search algorithm and for determining LD50 in pharmaceutical toxicity trials.

Not all evaluation is designed to maximize information gain. Validation tests strive for 100%
success, and rightly so. Exploratory testing, though -- seeking novelty -- is a sine qua non of
scientific research.

Not all uncertainty is valuable to resolve. We pay for tests with time and money. "Minimizing the
economic impact of variability is a profoundly different goal than minimizing variability."[^reinertsen]
