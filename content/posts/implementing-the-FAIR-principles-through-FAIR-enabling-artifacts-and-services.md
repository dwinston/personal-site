How does a [Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://researchsoftware.org/) &mdash; often
responsible for developing infrastructure to manage and share digital research objects (data,
models, code, notebooks, workflows, etc.) &mdash; get from "Yes, FAIR sounds great, but how?" to "I better
understand what the FAIR principles really mean and how I can put them into practice."? I hope the
diagram below can help.
