At a base level, an identifier is simple to trace -- 
it is the sequence (modulo concurrency) of assertions of which it is a part.

In fact, this can be the basis for tracing the representation of a "thing"
as the flock of relationships between identifiers, i.e. metadata,
that waxes and wanes in association with "the" identifier of the thing.
