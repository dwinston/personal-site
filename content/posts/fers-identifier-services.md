Here are some [identifier services](https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Identifier-service) listed as
such by [FIP Wizard]( <https://fip-wizard.ds-wizard.org>), a free-to-signup online tool to guide a
user in creating and publishing a machine-actionable FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP):

- [Old IGSN](http://purl.org/np/RAVZO6G2woBMry9K9sl-4YurlGM4x6GREjnWLhef-5TTk#IGSN)

  International Generic Sample Number before integration with DataCite


- [SDN CDI PID | SeaDataNet CDI PID](http://purl.org/np/RAk5umcWPZegtZTBJACkE9CDap7KNwSgR8umS3SnuvW2A#SDN_CDI_PID)

  SeaDataNet Common Data Persistent Identifier


- [U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) Data ID Service](http://purl.org/np/RAyIQx7rn1CDYgTqRlSbsZY0yQz46VxRzSgfMp138QInM#OSTI-DOI)

  Through the DOE Data ID Service, OSTI assigns persistent identifiers, known as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), to datasets submitted by DOE and its contractor and grantee researchers and registers the DOIs with DataCite to aid in citation, discovery, retrieval, and reuse.  OSTI assigns and registers DOIs for datasets for DOE researchers as a free service to enhance the Department's management of this important resource.


- [URI | Uniform Resource Identifier](http://purl.org/np/RA5-OsT0-sjRbcoFEGfOzkrcFtExipMRmoLErzg5QWL7c#URI)

  URI is a string that provides a unique address (either on the Internet or on another private network, such as a computer filesystem or an Intranet) representing a resource, and implicitly describes where a resource can be found. A resource identification need not suggest the retrieval of resource representations over the Internet, nor need they imply network-based resources at all.

There are currently four resources. I authored the entry for OSTI DOIs. "URI" doesn't seem like a
service. We have a long ways to go.
