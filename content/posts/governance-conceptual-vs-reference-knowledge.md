What do knowledge governance systems look like in practice?

By knowledge governance, I don't just mean governing ontologies. By knowledge, I mean categories/sets/types of things – what a thing "is," or at least what it is described to be in the information system – and the relationships between these types, as opposed to specific recorded facts. [^1]

Some practitioners explicitly separate "conceptual knowledge" (ontologies) from "reference knowledge" (vocabularies, taxonomies, enumerated lists, etc.), where "reference" doesn't necessarily reflect agreement – it could rather reflect chosen policy. [^2] This is also referred to as a TBox/CBox split [^3], where the traditional semantic-practitioner approach of a terminological "box" (TBox) for ontologies (i.e. defining terms) and assertional box (ABox) for assertions (i.e., recording data) is amended -- a so-called categorical box (CBox) is spun out of the TBox that could be governed seperately.

  change amid order.

You may not call what you are doing “governance” because you think that
if you do, you may get approached by some department representative who
tells you, “we can take it from here.” That’s fine.

But how do you manage change with respect to the parts of your
information systems that are not the specific recorded facts – i.e., the
ontologies, schema, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, enumerated
lists, etc.? I’d love to know.
