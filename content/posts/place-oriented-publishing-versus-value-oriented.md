In place-oriented publishing, as in place-oriented programming, you allocate places to push things, and you pull from places. Places steward values. “Where” something is, is important. Did you publish to a reputable place?

In value-oriented publishing, as in value-oriented programming, you pass around values, or references to values, not to places. You deal directly in values. Dereferencing services steward values. “What” something is, is important, not “where” something is. Did you publish something valued as reputable by other resources - peer reviews, other publications, etc. - that reference it and in turn are valued as reputable (c.f. PageRank)?
