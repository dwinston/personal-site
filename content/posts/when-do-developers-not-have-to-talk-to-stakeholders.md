An ontologist can bridge[^sequedalassila] domain expertise and software development via production of

1. a semi-informal so-called *intermediate representation*[^methonto] that can be understood by
   domain experts, and

2. a formal ontology / knowledge graph that represents the domain in a machine-actionable way.

> When you do software development, you want to take the human out of the loop as much as possible
-- really automate it, least amount of manual effort, just minimize that...When I explain to
[developers] that an ontology or knowledge graph [is] basically an ontologist talking to
stakeholders and making sure that all the implicit knowledge they have is expressed in an explicit
structural format that systems can also read...a light bulb [is] lit in their head, like "Oh...so it
means we do not have to talk to stakeholders?"...Yes!...You can basically have the ontologist talk
to the stakeholders and put it into a format that you just query."[^datatherapyonto]

And if you switch-hit as both a domain expert and a developer, "a little semantics goes a long way"
-- developing competence in and discipline towards producing intermediate representations can
increase your capacity to effectively collaborate/delegate and thus increase professional impact.
