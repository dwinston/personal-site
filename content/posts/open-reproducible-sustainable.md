Irving et al.[^1] approach digital research infrastructure through three related but
distinct concepts: openness, reproducibility, and sustainability.

Openness is about making digital resources generally accessible for
reuse, sharing, and adaptation through an open license.

Reproduciblity is about describing and documenting methods and results
so that anyone with access to the data and methods can re-apply the
methods on the data to obtain the same results.

Sustainability is about making it easy to maintain and extend a system
rather than replace it; this depends not just on the properties of an
artifact, but on the skills of potential maintainers and on the
investments of users.

If you share data and code, but you don’t document how to stage the data
and apply the code, the work is open but not reproducible.

If you document and automate your analysis, but the data is only
accessible to people in your lab, the work is reproducible but not open.

If your work is open and reproducible when initially published, but the
supporting system cannot be adequately maintained and extended, then the
sytem will become abandonware, and the work’s openness and
reproducibility will become less relevant.

To be sustainable, such a system must either be robust to a revolving
door of inexperienced maintainers and scattershot investments of one-off
users, or the field must develop a culture that values tool-building.

How does your team separately address the openness, reproducibility, and
sustainability of its research data product infrastructure?
