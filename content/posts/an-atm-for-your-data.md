An effective data unification system is like having an ATM network for your data.

Instead of having to get to a branch
(and only during open hours), wait in line, and talk to a teller, even for simple withdrawals and balance inquiries,
with an ATM you can do many common operations on-demand and quickly.

Similarly, instead of having to identify a data
source, get to the tools for querying it, perhaps waiting for pre-processing/updates, and often needing to talk to a
 data teller (engineer/administrator/analyst),
 with effective data unification you can answer common (whatever you define as common)
questions on-demand and quickly.
