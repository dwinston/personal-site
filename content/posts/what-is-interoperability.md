The seminal [article on FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) defines interoperability as "the ability of data or
tools from non-cooperating resources to integrate or work together with minimal effort."

Is the "non-cooperating" part important here? It is. You can think of this as [adversarial
interoperability](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability), as distinct from "indifferent
interoperability" (I don't care if you reuse this...for now) or "cooperative interoperability" (please reuse this...for
now). The term "adversarial" doesn't mean "evil" -- it means that a software agent acting on someone else's behalf isn't
"on your team", and is allowed to pursue goals that may surprise you.

Let's play with etymology a bit. To coordinate is to "co-ordinate", where "ordinate" shares a root with "ordinal", i.e.
categorical ordering, taxonomic classification. To coordinate is to "ordinate together." In particular, we might
"co-elaborate"/"co-labor" (collaborate) on data schema  and on sanctioned operations with data, i.e. we "co-operate".
Inter-operation, on the other hand, is distinct from co-operation (i.e., "intra-operation", within a group).

Why is such non-cooperative interoperability important? We have more data in the published literature than we know what
to do with, unless we use machines. We're still seeing data published in a way that 19th-century scientists  would
understand, rather than in a way appropriate to this century, with connectivity to electronic media and computing power.
Researchers need machine agents to "read" on their behalf, without prior coordination.

Does this make sense to you? Disagree vehemently? Let me know.
