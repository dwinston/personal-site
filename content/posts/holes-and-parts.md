What keeps a mouse contained in a box?

It is the way a box prevents motion in all directions. Each board bars escape in a certain direction. The left side keeps the mouse from going left, the right from going right, the top keeps it from leaping out, and so on.

The secret of a box is simply in how the boards are arranged to prevent motion in *all* directions. That's what *containing* means.

It's silly to expect any separate board by itself to contain any *containment*, even though each contributes to the containing. It is like the cards of a straight flush in poker; only the full hand has any value at all.

The same applies to words like *life* and *mind*. It is foolish to use these words for describing the smallest components of living things because these words were invented to describe how larger assemblies interact. Like *boxing-in*, words like *living* and *thinking* are useful for describing phenomena that result from certain combinations of relationships.

None of the 15 FAIR principles[^1] *contain* FAIR. A digital resource will not become "more FAIR" when it adheres to one rather than none of the principles.

However, just like *life* has gradually lost much of its mystery -- at least for modern biologists, because they understand so many of the important interactions among the chemicals in cells -- FAIR can be demystified by understanding how the components of a well-made FAIR resource interact to facilitate reuse and repurposing.[^2]
