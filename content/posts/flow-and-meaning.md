I recently came across a procedure for achieving a [flow
state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)):

1. One activity at a time.
2. The activity is meaningful to you.
3. You work at the edge of your abilities.

I can't recall the source of this. So, dear reader, please send me something I can cite if you have
encountered this 3-step procedure elsewhere.

In this post, I relate the above procedure to my recent post on
[mean-ing](/posts/mean-ing).

<aside> {{< md >}} Before I proceed: I've noticed myself starting to post notes that are more raw
and/or [woo-woo](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woo-woo) than perhaps typical. I'd like
to give myself permission to do this without placing undue burden on readers more interested in my
"regularly scheduled programming", that is, in notes on machine-centric science that are less raw
and/or less woo-woo. So, I have added the [#raw](/tags/raw) and [#woo-woo](/tags/woo-woo) tags to
this post, and I'll include them in future posts as appropriate. {{< /md >}} </aside>

Embracing step 1, step 2 follows - you can only do one thing at a time, so naturally you want to
avoid the unmeaningful.

On step 2: what does "meaningful"...mean? The activity is rich with [mean-ing](/posts/mean-ing),
that is, you can see a central tendency for the thing, but there is observable variation, so
frequent mean-ing is necessary. It is rewarding and satisfying to identify the possibility of and
the emerging value of a central tendency as you gather and characterize observations.

On step 3: gather observations that you don’t anticipate will be *too* different ("mean-ing"-wise),
so that while you may perturb the central tendency, it likely won’t change drastically after any
given iteration of the activity. If it does change drastically, you likely will experience worry and
anxiety. You will lose confidence in the mean-ing you’re doing / building up -- you will ask
yourself, "Is there actually a central tendency at all here?" Bottom line: you will want to take a
step back; you will exit flow.
