I keep confusing findability and discoverability. It seems that findability is often equated to
[known-item search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-item_search), and discoverability to
[exploratory search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_search).

Known-item search is compatible with "instant search", aka search-as-you-type interfaces.
Exploratory search is compatible with "autocomplete" (incl. re-spelling, infix matching, synonym
substitution, etc.) interfaces.

Recommendation can be a part of exploratory search, i.e. bundled in response to a user's pulling for
relevant information. It can also be pushed independently of deliberately registered search intent
-- via notifications, email digests, etc.

Does the latter activity -- the pushy one --  "count" for discoverability? I can imagine such
activity being framed as periodic re-running of an exploratory-search query on behalf of a user,
with query-independent factors for retrieval and ranking being varied over time.
