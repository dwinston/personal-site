Designing any society, be it human or computational, involves decisions like these:

* Which agents choose which others to do what jobs?
* Who will decide which jobs are done at all?
* Who decides what efforts to expend?
* How will conflicts be settled?

Furthermore, roles even in a hierarchy are always relative. To [*Builder*](https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-world-of-blocks/), *Add* is a subordinate, but to *Find*, *Add* is a boss. As for yourself, which sorts of thoughts concern you most -- the orders you are supposed to take or those you're supposed to give?
