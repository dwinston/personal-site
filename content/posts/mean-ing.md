A mean is a central tendency or location. Examples include arithmetic and geometric means. A
distribution can have a strong or weak central tendency, that is, a small or large dispersion,
respectively.

For an ensemble of observations to "have meaning," you must be able to "put your finger on it" --
the thing has a central tendency, a "location", that you can point to. If there is "no meaning",
then there is nothing you can point to -- it's too dispersed.

To attribute meaning to some "hazy" thing, i.e. something with high-enough semantic dispersion, you
-- in a sense -- perform "mean-ing" across its composition.
