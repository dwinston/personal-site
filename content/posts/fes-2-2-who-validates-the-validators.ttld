Given a fip:Metadata-schema and a validator for it,
such as a sh:Validator or a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), how do you determine that the
validator is...valid? That it speaks the desired fip:Knowledge-representation-language,
that it knows all the terms in a desired fip:Structured-vocabulary and checks their usage against a desired fip:Semantic-model?
In other words, that it adheres to a doap:Specification?

I do not know. However, I suspect that it is more important [to check output rather than input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle).
