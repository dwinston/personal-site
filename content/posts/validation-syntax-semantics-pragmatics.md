Validation is about preconditions for operation. It may be useful to separate preconditions into
three subtypes: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.[^1]

*Syntax*: Rules about what's grammatically well-formed. Example: A `CalculateAqueousStability`
command may have a set of atomic-composition pairs and a set of ion-concentration pairs. An
atomic-composition pair is a string paired with a number between 0 and 1. An ion-concentration pair
is a string paired with a number.

*Semantics*: Rules about what may be syntactically valid but is nonetheless nonsense. Example: A
`CalculateAqueousStability` command may be syntactically valid, but it's compositions don't add up
to 1, the ion concentrations are physically implausible, etc.

*Pragmatics*: Rules about contextual appropriateness for processing a syntactically and semantically
valid message. Example: an online system can't efficiently calculate stability for a system of more
than 4 atomic elements on-the-fly, so this kind of command is rejected.
