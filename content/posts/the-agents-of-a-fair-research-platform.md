To explain a FAIR research platform, we have to show how they are built from mindless stuff, smaller
and simpler than anything we'd consider smart. What could these simpler particles be -- the "agents"
that compose the platform? There are many questions to answer:

- Function: How do agents work?
- Embodiment: What are they made of?
- Interaction: How do they communicate?
- Learning: How do we make new agents and change old ones?
- Character: What are the most important kinds of agents?
- Authority: What happens when agents disagree?
- Intention: How could such networks want or wish?
- Competence: How can groups of agents do what separate agents cannot do?
- Selfness: What gives them unity or personality?
- Meaning: How could they understand anything?

These questions all seem difficult when we sever each one's connections to the other ones. But once
we see a platform as a society of agents, each answer can illuminate the rest.
