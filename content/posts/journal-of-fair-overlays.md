A *translucent* overlay journal could publish FAIR assets based on existing open-access
publications.

Typically, an [overlay journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_journal) is transparent -- it
is a window to selected already-available content. The value added to the existing body of content
is that of curation.

However, scholarly digital assets -- data, algorithms, tools, workflows, etc. -- that support the
narratives expressed in many publications are often insufficiently
[FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618). The primary emphasis of many journals is on
publishing the narrative, whereas digital assets are often de-emphasized as "supplementary
information".

For a journal of FAIR overlays, the narrative is supplementary. Source narratives need not be
re-published, that is, the journal is an overlay journal. The value added to the existing body of
content is that of "FAIRifying" the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom
([DIKW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid)).

Rather than resorting to natural language processing (NLP) of published narratives, researchers
could instead reference and repurpose a source publication's core digital assets through one or more
journal-of-FAIR-overlays publications, which are themselves scholarly objects that can be cited.
