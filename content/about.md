I grew up in Los Angeles, which blessed me with unconcern for weather in my youth. I studied electrical engineering and
computer science (EECS) at the University of California at Berkeley, where I had a lot of fun with the honor society Eta
Kappa Nu (HKN). After earning my bachelor's degree at Cal, I completed master's and PhD degrees in the EECS department
at MIT. My area of study there was nanofabrication, with both experimental and computational work, in Karl Berggren's
group. During that time, I also worked at IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, NY; at the National Institute for Standards
and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD; and at a Zeiss R&D facility in Peabody, MA.
 
 After MIT, I joined Stan Williams' non-volatile-memory (memristor) team at HP Labs in Palo Alto, CA as a postdoctoral
 researcher, with expertise in charged-particle-beam optics for fabrication and metrology. At this time, I developed an
 increasing passion for software engineering, for bits rather than atoms; and I knew the trade-off was illusory -- that
 many a bit is in service of manipulating and understanding atoms.
   
I quit HP Labs in order to retool myself with maximal self-direction. I learned web development, worked on open-source
tools, and co-founded a startup before learning about a unique opportunity at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). For
roughly five years, I was the principal web developer (full-stack) and data/systems engineer for the Materials Project,
an academic/government effort to aid data-driven discovery of energy-related materials. I developed/maintained
databases, APIs, web apps, and other code to help scientists make sense of lots of simulation data and to dramatically
enhance collaboration and the impact of findings.

I decided to move to New York City in the Fall of 2019, where I joined the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a
marvelous venue for a professional mini-sabbatical. I now run a [software and data consulting
practice](https://polyneme.xyz/), with expertise in helping researchers do data-intensive science together. [Email
