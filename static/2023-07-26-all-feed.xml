<p>Your digital research assets are outputs in some stories and inputs in others.
Some of these stories are yet to be told — even stories where an asset is an output.
Imagine the serendipity of a future research project producing a digital asset with the same SHA256 hash<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> as a previously registered asset.</p>

<p>The things of concern<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> are materials, processes, measurements, and ingredients.
Materials are output by processes and are subject to measurements.
A process may take materials as ingredients.</p>
<p>Things are recorded in three ways: as templates, as specs, and as runs.
You can record a template for a thing &ndash; what might be the case.
You can also record a spec for a thing &ndash; what is intended.
Finally, you can record a run for a thing &ndash; what is, or was.</p>
<p>Each thing can have attributes from three categories: properties, parameters, and conditions.
A property is something measured or calculated.
A parameter is something set.
A condition describes an aspect of the thing&rsquo;s environment.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The key technical foundations for FAIRifying data are (1) ubiquitous persistent identifiers; (2) rich controlled metadata; and (3) granular programmatic access. These foundations provide a basis for FAIR data infrastructure.</p>
<p>This note is inspired by <a href="https://anchor.fm/fairdatapodcast/episodes/Sharif-Islam-e1siagt">Rory Macneil’s recent interview with Sharif Islam on the FAIR Data Podcast</a>, published on 2022-12-21. In particular, I expand on the Q&amp;A segment starting at PT14M10S.</p>
<h1 id="ubiquitous-persistent-identifiers-pids">ubiquitous persistent identifiers (PIDs)</h1>
<p>Identifiers must be persistent.
Persistence is a matter of service, which needs organizational support.
Furthermore, you are playing on hard mode here if you don’t ensure global uniqueness via HTTPS URIs.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Crucially, PIDs must be ubiquitous across data holdings.
A single PID that addresses all study-publication data elements as an aggregate, e.g. “one DOI for the primary article’s supplemental dataset”, is insufficient.</p>
<h1 id="rich-controlled-metadata">rich controlled metadata</h1>
<p>Metadata makes PIDs findable. Catalogs and search portals use metadata to help you find PID-associated content. Metadata elements must be controlled; that is, so-called controlled vocabularies must be used to boost (a) leverage in tagging and (b) precision and recall in retrieval, which is critical with “big” data-item collections. Furthermore, the controlled metadata needs  to be rich — tracking only “minimal” required metadata elements is insufficient. Finally, you are playing on hard mode if your control mechanism does not use PIDs for knowledge organization. A system of least power here is the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization System (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/">SKOS</a>).</p>
<h1 id="granular-programmatic-access">granular programmatic access</h1>
<p>Programmatic access must be supported. A well-documented, open-standards-based protocol
facilitates machine-to-machine interactions to glue things together
in a way that is distinct from affordances possible with human-centered interfaces (including bespoke APIs) and portals. This programmatic access must be granular — egress costs scale with data volume delivered, so let users sub-select slices of data. You are again playing on hard mode if programmatic access, and communicating granularity of such access, does not use PIDs. The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html">HTTP</a> protocol and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html">URI</a> scheme were designed for this, as were the W3C Resource Description Framework (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/">RDF</a>) Recommendations.</p>

<p>[update 2022-12-25]: Global uniqueness for HTTPS URIs in practice is ensured either by (1) securing an HTTP URI <code>authority</code> component via the Domain Name System (DNS) or (2) securing a DNS-authority-delegated URI <code>path</code> prefix such as through w3id.org, the ARK alliance, or a DONA handle system (e.g. DOI) agent.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>A microservices approach seems apt for FAIR-enabling services that need to be composed, flexibly,
for any given research artifact&rsquo;s digital lifecycle. Consider these services:</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The &ldquo;one platform<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to rule them all&rdquo; is unlikely to be realized for scientific research in
any domain. Rather, instead of small and numerous on-premises silos for data + code + compute, we
are on track to achieve large and somewhat less numerous cloud-based silos.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the alternative? A focus on microservices &ndash; so-called to emphasize that they generally do
not stand alone, but rather are components of larger workflows/services &ndash; such as data-slicing and
data-summary-layer services that allow you to bring big data to code+compute by effectively
subsetting/streaming it.<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>But how? One approach is to pursue domain-driven design that is devoid of architecture/orchestration
concerns but that yields domain events, wrapped by event-driven microservices that deal with
specific technology choices, wrapped finally by entrypoint interfaces driven by user/user-agent
personas and their use cases.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

<![CDATA[<p>I have sought to identify and enumerate core <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/fair-enabling-services/">FAIR-enabling
services</a>. I attempted a <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/a-five-week-experiment-to-elaborate-on-fair-enabling-services/">five-week
experiment</a>
to expand on my tentative list, but I did not complete it. The list wasn&rsquo;t compelling for me.</p>
<p>I have been brewing an updated list of core FAIR-enabling services, which I hope to be less
bombastic about. Nevertheless, I want to share with you this list and my thoughts about concretizing
them through pedagogically minded demo implementations tied together by a running example that I
intend to refine and deploy for a real project.</p>
<p>FAIR-Enabling services:</p>
<ol>
<li>an identifier <em>minter</em> (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/jkunze/docker-arknoid">arknoid</a>)</li>
<li>a metadata <em>tracker</em> (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb">terminusdb</a>)</li>
<li>a metadata <em>transactor</em> (<a href="https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb">terminusdb</a> schema)</li>
<li>a metadata <em>indexer</em>, to feed a search engine (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch">elasticsearch</a>)</li>
<li>an identifier metadata <em>resolver</em> (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi">fastapi</a> with conneg)</li>
<li>a data object <em>retriever</em> (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio">minio</a> s3 presigned urls)</li>
<li>a metadata <em>harmonizer</em> (e.g. <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/">cambria</a>-esque json patch graph)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to demo a service stack via <code>docker-compose</code>. Some resources I am thinking to consult or
leverage directly here are <a href="https://github.com/jkunze/docker-arknoid">arknoid</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb">TerminusDB</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/minio/minio">MinIO</a>, and
<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/">Project Cambria</a>.</p>
<p>My intended running example is the incorporation of heliophysics concepts into the <a href="https://astrothesaurus.org/">Unified
Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT)</a> and harmonizing that with the
<a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a> concept scheme so that one may evaluate semantics-fueled
improvements to query understanding and thus search-result relevance via the OpenAlex dataset. The
OpenAlex dataset has value as a testbed for improvements to in-production search engines such as the
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/">SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Why would one consider indexing validators? Reuse.</p>
<p>The value of reuse seems obvious for structural and semantic <em>specification</em>, i.e. schemas and
controlled vocabularies &ndash; there is opportunity to perceive two datasets as aligned. But, this
alignment is only <em>indicated</em>, not necessarily <em>validated</em>.</p>
<p>Two datasets, A and B, are stated to both conform to schema S. If you wish to verify this, what do
you do? You apply a validator V to both. Therefore, it seems that if the same validator V is already
stated to have been successfully applied to both datasets A and B in order to verify conformance to
S, you will have higher confidence in proceeding to analysis without applying validation yourself,
or at least without insisting on comprehensive, compute-intensive validation by default.</p>
<p>A given schema-specification validator may also be relatively sophisticated and transform an input
dataset to conform more tightly to the specification, as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postel&rsquo;s
Law</a>, making it even more valuable to reuse
unambiguously identified validators as part of data-integration workflows.</p>
<p>Validators may be composed, e.g. conjunctively as <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/schema/schema.html#entity-predicates">attribute/predicate specs are in
Datomic</a>, encouraging
granular reuse. However, one could not naively employ conformers-as-validators in such a scheme
unless they formed a commutative semigroup (mutually rectifying robustness &ndash; Postel would
approve!).</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Indexing identifiers is key to disambiguating entities.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Disambiguation_pages">disambiguation pages</a>.
For example, there are various concepts in mathematics and computing, various computing products,
and various companies that identify with the term
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision">Precision</a>&rdquo;. I made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220906121536/https://legacy.materialsproject.org/Fe2O3/">disambiguation pages for
same-chemical-formula inorganic crystal
structures</a>
for the Materials Project.</p>
<p>Indexing identifiers is also key to unifying entities. It&rsquo;s an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Open-world_assumption">open
world</a> after all,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> with a comcomitant
<a href="https://chempedia.info/info/nonunique_naming_assumption/">non-unique naming assumption</a>. OpenAlex
<a href="https://docs.openalex.org/about-the-data/work#ids">indexes various ID types for a work</a>. For
example,
<a href="http://api.openalex.org/works/https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375">http://api.openalex.org/works/https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375</a>
will funnel you to the payload for <code>https://openalex.org/W2741809807</code>, which has an <code>ids</code> field with
<code>openalex</code>, <code>doi</code>, <code>mag</code> (Microsoft Academic Graph), <code>pmid</code> (Pubmed), and <code>pmcid</code> (Pubmed Central)
IDs.</p>
<p>Finally, indexing identifiers is key to registering and resolving metadata, i.e. relationships
between identifiers. Registries include <a href="https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov">Linked Open Vocabularies
(LOV)</a>, the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index">Ontology Lookup Service
(OLS)</a>, the <a href="https://prefix.zazuko.com/">Zazuko Prefix Server</a>, and
the <a href="https://obofoundry.org/">OBO Foundry</a>. Resolvers include
<a href="https://identifiers.org/">Identifiers.org</a> and <a href="https://n2t.net/">Name-To-Thing (n2t)</a>. There is
even at least one <em>meta</em>registry, <a href="https://bioregistry.io/">Bioregistry.io</a>.</p>
<p>Any time you encounter a web service using a &ldquo;remote data access&rdquo; style, i.e. exposing a query
language via a single access point &ndash; SQL, SPARQL, GraphQL, MongoDB, etc. &ndash; its highly likely that
all entity identifiers are indexed to support efficient retrieval and combination/joining.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>How do you validate a reified trace of digital-object provenance?</p>
<p>Is it even possible? This is syntactic validation. Values that should be strings are strings, dates
are dates, lists are lists, you know the drill&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it plausible? This is semantic validation. This date should be earlier (i.e., &ldquo;less than&rdquo; in
ISO8601 format) than that date, this number should be an integer multiple of that number, this
field&rsquo;s values are unique across the collection, this field is a reference to an object of that
type, etc. Also known as structural validation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This seems to me to be a really important  problem. In my experience a lot of the discussion about
things like PIDs and controlled vocabularies seems to assume that these things just exist. But when
you actually go to try to use them and make them usable  in the context of tools that people use in
research,  that presents a whole additional series of challenges;  I think oftentimes  those
challenges are overlooked or ignored or not even thought about  by people who are doing work in PIDs

<p>If a resource is accesible from an HTTP server, then as a client you may <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation">negotiate the content

<p>There may be many ways to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/#dfn-functional-specification">functionally

<p>Thus, it seems that one way to &ldquo;validate translation&rdquo; would be to identify the functional profile

input with a checksum so that the service can verify that your input is plausible. A service gives
you a content hash so that you can verify that its output is plausible. But how do you identify what
is being done, and to which field (<a href="https://github.com/multiformats/cid">perhaps it&rsquo;s done to the object identifier
itself</a>)? One useful standard is the HTTP

<p>We should accept the premise that people will not run their own servers by designing systems that

<![CDATA[<p>This week on Machine-Centric Science, I interviewed Martynas Jusevičius, currently at AtomGraph and
based in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p>Topics we spoke about included: cell-based UI as computational canvases (e.g. Jupyter), personal
knowledge graph tools and block UI protocols, the Solid Pod spec and ecosystem for decentralized
data ownership and visiting, and the roles both of researchers and those who develop software for
them in realizing FAIR-principled implementations.</p>

<h1 id="quotable-quotes">Quotable Quotes</h1>
<p>&ldquo;The RDF graph data model&hellip;seems like the only realistic implementation at this point for the FAIR
principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, FAIR data is more or less equal to Linked Data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The software has to be built around these principles. And that&rsquo;s maybe quite a radical idea because
for a long time, data was just like an add-on to software, right? But essentially now it&rsquo;s the
inverse. It&rsquo;s the data that is at the center &ndash; that&rsquo;s the data-centric paradigm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;there has to be some kind of paradigm shift, both in how researchers see this, but also for
those who develop software for researchers, that what scientific publishing produces is not just
PDFs&hellip;Through fair data, we can look at scientific publishing as this huge network of research
artifacts that can be navigated, explored &ndash; as a knowledge graph naturally &ndash; but also recombined,
reused and repurposed in different things.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Where do you look for identifiers?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a URI, the IANA has a <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">registry of
schemes</a>, like <code>https</code>, <code>mailto</code>,
and <code>tel</code>.</p>
<p>These days, to resolve an identifier, you generally use the <code>https</code> scheme, which has an <code>authority</code>
component in its URI format. You can go with content addressing like <a href="https://ipld.io/glossary/#cid">IPLD
CIDs</a>, but that doesn&rsquo;t solve where to look &ndash; it solves knowing that
you found the thing (or that you already have the thing).</p>
<p>Authority is hard to persist. So people and organizations pool efforts towards generic authority
under the <code>https</code> URI scheme, like <code>hdl.handle.net</code>, <code>doi.org</code>, <code>n2t.net</code>, <code>identifiers.org</code>,
<code>purl.org</code>, <code>w3id.org</code>, <code>wikidata.org</code>, etc. Or they pool towards authority with narrower scope,
like <code>orcid.org</code>, <code>ror.org</code>, <code>igsn.org</code>, etc. Or they just pursue lasting authority with a new
<code>.org</code> or through a trusted <code>.gov</code>, etc.</p>
<p>How do you index identifiers from various sources? There are efforts like
<a href="https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/">LOV</a> for vocabularies, and
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> and <a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> for DOIs.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a> is setting a nice example of collecting identifiers from
various systems and connecting them, along with descriptive metadata.</p>
<p>What about collecting identifier services? Is this of interest? Is it a fool&rsquo;s errand due to the
rise and fall of authority? Or is tracking and using the rising and falling of reputation and
reliability, Google-PageRank-style, a way to shepherd researchers to robust persistence of
identifiers?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you know that a given ID provided by a service is unique, that tells you <em>nothing at all</em> about
the uniqueness of another ID provided by that service. You need to understand &ndash; be able to reason

implements that algorithm.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you know that an ID provided by a service is bound to a particular digital object and/or to

that ID to tomorrow. You need to understand and trust any policy provided by that service regarding

</blockquote>
<p>If you know that a service resolves an ID request to metadata describing a digital object and its

<![CDATA[<p>Day 1 of my <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/a-five-week-experiment-to-elaborate-on-fair-enabling-services/">five-week experiment to elaborate on FAIR-enabling
services</a>,
and I already find myself fallen flat on my face.</p>
<p>I had wanted to go through motions of brainstorming concepts related to the service of identifying,
partition them into concepts, attributes, and relationships in the sense of Sequeda and
Lassila&rsquo;s<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &ldquo;Knowledge Report&rdquo; intermediate representation &ndash; for each, draft a table to name it,
provide an alternative name or two, a definition, an identifier for the thing, an identifier
template for instances of the things culled from sources, and a query to get instance from sources
&ndash; or at least a nod to how one might proceed with these, particularly for the last two items.</p>
<p>I instead found myself in Philadelphia for longer than anticipated, for reasons I may or may not
divulge over a beer, and so here&rsquo;s what I came up with in the limited timebox I gave myself to push
<em>something</em> out today:</p>
<figure><img src="/img/fes-identifying-concepts.png" width="100%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Identifying some concepts (attributes? relationships?) about identifying</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An identifying service provided guarantees wrt protocol, policy, and algorthims to make good on the
guarantees. These guarantees revolve around the nature of requests and responses. Requests wrt
identifying are about minting new IDs, binding information to minted IDs, or resolving supplied IDs
to bound information. Responses are either the thing identified, information about the thing, or
where to get the thing.</p>
<p>Okay, timebox is over. Yes, leaves in the diagram above have gone unexplained. Thankfully, there are
more days for thinking, i.e. writing.</p>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/fair-enabling-services/">Yesterday</a>, I proposed that a strategy for
implementing the <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/FAIR">FAIR principles</a> for research data
management can focus on ensuring five FAIR-enabling <em>services</em>, which in turn will prompt tactical
choices of <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FAIR-Enabling-Resource">FAIR-enabling resources</a> that
may satisfactorily address each <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Question">question</a> and thereby
produce a comprehensive <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology">implementation profile</a>. The
purpose of such care in design is to de-risk one&rsquo;s investment in &ldquo;going FAIR&rdquo;, as the cost of
systems implementation and maintenance can easily exceed the cost of a design phase by an order of
magnitude.</p>
<p>These FAIR-enabling services are, again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identifying</li>
<li>Validating</li>
<li>Indexing</li>
<li>Translating</li>
<li>Tracing</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than cursory remarks, I am yet to elaborate in any detail the behavior I expect from these
services. I would like to remedy this over the next five weeks, one week per service, in the order
given above.</p>
<p>And there is a constraint I would like to impose on myself: each week will be a five-day progression
of notes that reflects the service sequence above. For example, during the first week (on
Identifying), I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On Day 1: Identify the concepts, attributes, and relationships at play in Identifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Day 2: Assert and validate a set of statements, using elements that I identified the day
before, that should hold for Identifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Day 3: Demonstrate a process of Indexing the above in order to efficiently retrieve
assertions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Day 4: Assert relationships among schemes for Identifying, and attempt Translating from one to
another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Day 5: Demonstrate a process of Tracing revisions made to the metadata that Identifying
yields (i.e., what is returned when an identifier is resolved).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this five-week planned experiment ambitious? Yes? Is it <em>too</em> ambitious? Almost certainly yes.
Will I attempt it anyway? Yes.</p>
<p>Would I appreciate your day-to-day feedback for course correction? Yes. And I would enthusiastically
acknowledge your contribution when collecting and clarifying the sum of each week&rsquo;s notes.</p>

<![CDATA[<p><small>(The following is a transcript of my recent <a href="https://podcast.polyneme.xyz/episodes/fair-enabling-services">podcast
episode</a> on this topic.)</small></p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology">FAIR Implementation Profile ontology</a>, and
it talks about <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FAIR-Enabling-Resource">FAIR-enabling resources</a>. So
these are corresponding to <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Question">questions</a>. For each of
the fifteen <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/FAIR">FAIR principles</a>, this FAIR-enabling
resource, the idea is that you&rsquo;ve identified a
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-No-Choice-Declaration">challenge</a> or you&rsquo;ve made a
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Declaration">choice</a> about some resource that&rsquo;s going to help
you fulfill that &ndash; either that resource is
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/declares-current-use-of">available</a>, or it&rsquo;s <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/declares-planned-use-of">planned</a>, or it&rsquo;s
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/declares-planned-development-of">proposed</a>, or you&rsquo;re going to
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/declares-planned-replacement-of">phase it out</a>, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Twelve FAIR-enabling resources have been identified as broad categories that help address each of
the challenges with FAIR principles. One is an <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Identifier-service">identifier
service</a>. This is a service that provides for
any digital object, (1) algorithms guaranteeing global uniqueness; (2) a policy document that
guarantees persistence; and (3) resolution of the identifier to machine actionable metadata
describing the object and its location.</p>
<p>This is all into under Findable. Another FAIR-enabling resource is <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Metadata-schema">metadata
schema</a>. So this would be a specification, a
schema, that specifies metadata fields describing attributes of data or other digital objects.
Another FAIR-enabling resource would be a <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Metadata-data-linking-schema">metadata-data linking
schema</a>. So this would be,
specifically, a specification &ndash; schema &ndash; that provides a unique, persistent, ideally
bi-directional machine actionable link between metadata and the data they describe. And the final
FAIR-enabling resource for the Findable principles is a
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Registry">registry</a>, which is a service that indexes metadata and
data and provides a search over that index.</p>
<p>For Accessible, there are three identified FAIR-enabling resources. <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Communication-protocol">Communication
protocol</a>: so this is a specification for
how messages are structured and exchanged. There&rsquo;s <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Authentication-and-authorization-service">authentication and authorization
service</a>. So this is a
service that mediates access to digital objects according to specified conditions.</p>
<p>And another FAIR-enabling resource is a <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Metadata-preservation-policy">metadata preservation
policy</a>. So this would be a document
that describes the conditions under which metadata are to be provisioned in the future, maybe part
of a data management plan.</p>
<p>Okay. Five more FAIR-enabling resources identified. We&rsquo;re going to Interoperability now. One is a
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Knowledge-representation-language">knowledge representation language</a>: a language specification whereby
knowledge can be made processable by machines. Another FAIR-enabling resource is <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Structured-vocabulary">structured
vocabulary</a>: a controlled list of uniquely
identified and unambiguous concepts with their definitions represented preferably using web
standards.</p>
<p>Finally, in Interoperable, a FAIR-enabling resource would be a <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Semantic-model">semantic
model</a>, a specification that defines qualified
relations between entities describing data or other digital objects using structured vocabularies.</p>
<p>The two remaining FAIR-enabling resources, under Reusable, are (1) <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Data-usage-license">data usage
license</a> &ndash; so that&rsquo;s a document that describes
the conditions under which a digital object can be legally used. And finally, a <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/Provenance-model">provenance
model</a>; a specification &ndash; schema &ndash; that
specifies metadata fields describing the origin and lineage of data or other digital objects.</p>
<p>So these are a bunch of FAIR-enabling resources. I was thinking about this a bit, and I wanted to
distinguish between things that actually have to be running in order for data to be alive and for
you to actually find it, access it, interoperate with it, reuse it, versus things that are resources
that those services will need that are more &ldquo;one-time&rdquo; things.</p>
<p>For example, a metadata schema isn&rsquo;t really a service, so to speak. It&rsquo;s something that you can do
and be done with. You might need to make revisions of it, so maybe there&rsquo;s some change management
procedure. But in terms of the actual service, it isn&rsquo;t quite like an identifier service, where you
want to be given an identifier and be able to know where to go, and resolve that identifier, and
determine if you have the right identifier and then get the data, get the metadata. So that&rsquo;s an
actual service that needs to be run. If not continuously, whenever you decide you need
identification, you can spin up that service and do that, but it&rsquo;s an actual service that needs to
be run in order for you to have living findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability.</p>
<p>So of these 12 FAIR-enabling resources, I&rsquo;ve thought about how to condense them into FAIR-enabling
<em>services</em>. What are the actual <em>services</em> that are really important across these that someone needs
to worry about if they want a FAIR data ecosystem in their lab and their lifecycle for research,
that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve identified these as (1) An identification service, an identifier service. You need to be able
to identify things. And this is identifying metadata, datasets, as well as vocabulary things. So
this spans, say, F1, the A principles, as well as I2 in terms of making a vocabulary FAIR, being
able to unambiguously identify vocabulary terms. So identification is a big service that&rsquo;s needed.</p>
<p>The second service is validation. So, you could be given a metadata schema and given statements and
assertions, but how do you know they actually conform to the schema? Are you going to look those up
by hand? Are you going to kind of cross check with a sheet of paper that you have in front of you
that says the schema? No, you really want a validation service that will validate statements
according to a schema that you&rsquo;re imposing.</p>
<p>The third service is indexing. So this is related to the registry. You need something that, given a
bunch of statements that have identifiers that resolve, a bunch of statements that are valid
according to the schema &ndash; so you&rsquo;ve identified, you validated. You then need to collect them and be
able to find what you need. And so that involves indexing. So that&rsquo;s an actual service where you can
search the index. An index is the basis of search. Otherwise you&rsquo;re just doing a full scan of all
your statements. You won&rsquo;t get any leverage. You won&rsquo;t be able to winnow down with any efficiency at
all. So this index thing, this ongoing indexing, where you have an index and you maintain an index
and when you identify new concepts or data, assign them identifiers, validate your statements about
them, you want to throw them in the index and you want your registry to re-index things. So that
indexing needs to be a service.</p>
<p>The fourth FAIR-enabling service to me is translation. So, this is the essence of interoperation.
This is the point of having a knowledge representation language and a semantic model where you&rsquo;re
defining qualified relations. The idea being, you have a bunch of metadata and you want to use it
for something else. So you need some service to actually translate it. If you have data in some
format, you want to be able to translate it. You want these qualified links to know that, if you
have metadata of this format, say of a schema.org Dataset and you want a DCAT Dataset, you know the
corresponding mapping and you can perform that translation. So that would be a FAIR-enabling service
that would leverage resources like semantic model, structured vocabulary, language &ndash; ultimately, it
would leverage your index as well. So, translation would also be dependent on an index, just like
search is.</p>
<p>And the final service that I think is important here is tracing. So, given something, you want to
trace &ldquo;where did it come from?&rdquo;, and how you can use it. So this connects directly to your, static
or not, policies about usage rights, data usage, and your provenance model. And this is how you can
actually trace where things are, to determine if you can reuse it. So this is something active that
you want. You want something, and again, this would ultimately leverage an index as well. So you&rsquo;d
have a bunch of data objects and metadata objects and vocabulary terms, all of which would need to
be identified, so that&rsquo;d be an identifying service. All of your statements about things, about
provenance, mapping for translation, indexing, all of that would have to be validated. So you have
the validation service, and then finally you have the indexing. And that puts everything in. And the
indexing is the basis of support for search, which I don&rsquo;t think needs to be a separate
FAIR-enabling service &ndash; there are various ways of searching over an index, given it. But it also
enables this translation based on the semantics that you have in your model and your resources, and
tracing to determine, can I use this? What&rsquo;s the provenance of this? Was it based on things that
fell under this certain license? And so, depending on the license of my transformations, this is
what I can use it for.</p>
<p>So again, these FAIR-enabling services are: Identifying, Validating, Indexing, Translating, and
Tracing. And I hope to go into more detail about how these relate to the FAIR principles and the
resources, and sort of elaborate on them individually over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Through the DOE Data ID Service, OSTI assigns persistent identifiers, known as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), to datasets submitted by DOE and its contractor and grantee researchers and registers the DOIs with DataCite to aid in citation, discovery, retrieval, and reuse.  OSTI assigns and registers DOIs for datasets for DOE researchers as a free service to enhance the Department&rsquo;s management of this important resource.</p>

<p>URI is a string that provides a unique address (either on the Internet or on another private network, such as a computer filesystem or an Intranet) representing a resource, and implicitly describes where a resource can be found. A resource identification need not suggest the retrieval of resource representations over the Internet, nor need they imply network-based resources at all.</p>

</ul>
<p>There are currently four resources. I authored the entry for OSTI DOIs. &ldquo;URI&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem like a
service. We have a long ways to go.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Repurposing data is hard sometimes. Given a current application&rsquo;s data-worldview &ndash; i.e., its schema
&ndash; one cannot in general pull in historical data collected for different applications because those
applications had different worldviews &ndash; i.e., they used different data schemas.</p>
<p>One may perform one-off or ongoing transformations &ndash; e.g. ETL jobs &ndash; as part of a hub-and-spoke
strategy to bring data from past worlds into the &ldquo;present&rdquo; world so that all the data can be queried
in a uniform way, in the language of the present-application schema.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the &ldquo;present&rdquo; world is a moving target. And &ldquo;past&rdquo; worlds may be merely dormant &ndash;
they may become &ldquo;present&rdquo; again if a given application is revisited.</p>
<p>Rather than hub-and-spoke schema convergence and single-timeline data migration, what if schema
translation infrastructure sought to reconcile queries across multiple worlds? That is, what if
application-X-centric questions could travel to and collect partial information from
other-application-centric worlds using the languages (schema) of those worlds?</p>
<p>Building off Ink &amp; Switch&rsquo;s ideas on edit lenses for schema evolution<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and off Radul and
Sussman&rsquo;s ideas on propagation networks for computation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, as well as off the observed
salubrious hourglassing of the Internet&rsquo;s layered-architecture design<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, I&rsquo;m thinking about
how to facilitate effective &ldquo;schema networking&rdquo; that acknowledges and embraces the never-ending
schema evolution characteristic of data collection efforts by research-producing organizations.</p>
<h2 id="initial-scribbles">Initial Scribbles</h2>
<p>First, I offer a simplified recapitulation of the layered architecture of the Internet:</p>
<figure><img src="/img/internet-layers-written.png" width="80%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Layered Architecture for the Internet</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next, I offer a mapping of the above to an analogous six-layered architecture for schema
translation:</p>
<figure><img src="/img/schema-translation-infra-layers-written.png" width="80%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Layered Architecture for Schema Translation</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <em>physical protocol</em> layer is concerned with data (de)serialization/marshalling and storage. The
<em>data-link protocol</em> layer is where ETL happens &ndash; how bytes are de-isolated and made accessible to
the network. The <em>network protocol</em> layer is where propagation among worldviews/schemas &ldquo;runs&rdquo;, with
each &ldquo;cell&rdquo; (in the parlance of the propagation network literature) a join-semilattice (or is it a
meet-semilattice?) world that accumulates partial information via edit-lens functional propagators.
The <em>transport protocol</em> layer is RDF over HTTP (<a href="/posts/a-fair-digital-object/">FAIR Digital
Objects</a>?), the <em>application protocol</em> layer is RDF query (SPARQL, a
Datalog, etc.), and the <em>application</em> layer is where specific-worldview-conforming data  (i.e.,
things you plot, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on, select/engineer features from to feed
to ML-model training, etc.) materialize.</p>
<p>Finally, I offer a rough diagram of how various layer activities and dataflow within/between them
may be visualized:</p>
<figure><img src="/img/schema-translation-infra-layers-diagram.png" width="80%"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Schema Translation Infrastructure in Action</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I want to close by noting that the problem of schema reconnection comes up not only with research
laboratory datasets that were collected independently by different teams, but also with datasets
collected over a long period of time by a single team as project/application requirements evolve and
place adaptation pressure on the &ldquo;working&rdquo; schema to undergo several revisions, thus necessitating
reconnection among schema versions (i.e. migrations, but not necessarily unidirectional if, say, a
sub-team is still using an &ldquo;old&rdquo; schema and wants to contribute &ldquo;new&rdquo; data).</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Inference based on semantic retrieval is more robust than inference based on syntactic parsing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>identifiers should be as dumb as possible &ndash; in other words, should include as little metadata as
possible about the thing being identified, leaving all information to be retrieved from metadata
repositories rather than inferred from the identifier itself. People always want to infer meaning,
and will often try to teach machines to do the same. The problem is that apparent meaning in the
structure of an identifier is all too often misleading&hellip;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to be authoritative, identifiers should be assigned as early as practicable in the creation
process, but minting is not binding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functions delay binding; data structures induce binding. Moral: Structure data late in the
programming process.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Identifier resolution delays binding; identifier structures induce binding. Moral: Structure
identifiers late (or never) in the minting process.</p>
<p>Also, structure identifier resolution (i.e. retrieved-metadata structure) late. Metadata is about claims;
there may be many and different claims about the same thing. &ldquo;Multiple resolution&rdquo;, i.e. making
different metadata sources/profiles/formats accessible depending on what a client is trying to
retrieve, is akin to functional polymorphism and hence even later binding.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>This week on Machine-Centric Science, I interviewed Shreyas Cholia, currently at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California.</p>
<p>Topics we spoke about included: data lifecycles, edge computing for data firehoses, provenance,
standards, broad versus detailed domain vocabularies, scope for common APIs, and identifier
leveling.</p>
<p><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/40860a6a">HAVE A LISTEN »</a></p>
<h1 id="quotable-quotes">Quotable Quotes</h1>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe what that really means is that this publication step so to speak just needs to be pushed
further upstream&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s just conceptualizing the data lifecycle as being not so much a linear thing as much as
it is just a bunch of different steps that could be applied to the data at different stages, and
really any of those steps could happen at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little bit of a disconnect right now&hellip;each domain tends to have a lot of detail that
gets obscured by these high-level specifications&hellip;we&rsquo;re seeing some interesting friction&hellip;things
that evolved from different spaces, it&rsquo;s interesting to see how they&rsquo;re trying to come together
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The holy grail is&hellip;everyone can look at everything and everyone can talk to each other&hellip;in this
dataset, that&rsquo;s what this column means and that&rsquo;s what this field means and that&rsquo;s how I can compare
these two things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot more to harmonization than just making sure things are in the same unit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The driving force here is more about machine readability and machine interpretability of the data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one&rsquo;s tricky&hellip;it&rsquo;s a little bit of a moving target in terms of where you see scientific value
occurring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much of what matters is at the metadata level&hellip;If that&rsquo;s different for different domains, which
it will be, having the &lsquo;one API to rule them all&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t really make a lot of sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the highest level, DOIs are great&hellip;there are, though, a lot of identifiers that are kind of not
&lsquo;DOI-level&rsquo; identifiers&hellip;more low-level for tracking and provenance&hellip;down to the level of the
individual datum&hellip;a row in a spreadsheet, or a single JSON object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late to start thinking about coming together and trying to standardize your
data&hellip;Please also spend a lot of time seeing what&rsquo;s out there and trying to work with existing
standards and trying to be a part of the broader ecosystem rather than doing your own thing.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>This week on Machine-Centric Science, I interviewed Patrick Huck, currently staff on the Materials
Project at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California. We talk about choices
and considerations in implementing FAIR.</p>
<p><a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/dc5be09e">LISTEN NOW »</a></p>
<p>There are show notes at the link above. Also, I tried to summarize our discussion as a <a href="https://np.petapico.org/RARgDGc4UYSdRmNq-BtZ4_Gd0ZvE08yms-Ew__tGwbolE">draft FAIR
Implementation Profile
(FIP)</a>.</p>
<h1 id="talking-points">Talking Points</h1>
<p>Career paths for people that are scientists AND software engineers.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) DOI Service.</p>
<p>What gets a DOI? Granularity of resources.</p>
<p>Partnering with the Novel Materials Discovery (NOMAD) Laboratory for accessing raw data.</p>
<p>Modeling: with Python classes and with OpenAPI.</p>
<p>API Gateway design for authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Provenance: for calculation workflows and for structure sourcing (credit to submitters!).</p>
<h1 id="quotable-quotes">Quotable Quotes</h1>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a big topic in science generally. What are the career paths for people that are
software engineers that are also scientists or maybe scientists first and software engineers second,
and have gone that route? It&rsquo;s not like there&rsquo;s H indexes for people like me in terms of
publications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;[OSTI] provides the infrastructure for minting those DOIs and making sure that those links are
always live. We&rsquo;ve become over the years with now, I think 147,000 DOIs, their biggest data client.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We use what&rsquo;s called robocrystallographer, which gets descriptions based on machine learning that
we get based on the information that we calculate about that structure. And then we can take that
description auto generated from our database entries and send it as metadata for the DOIs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of transparent without even knowing that there&rsquo;s an API behind it. To the extent that
sometimes people talk about the API and they actually mean the client. I think that&rsquo;s a good thing.
People in our space expect those things to be pretty transparent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that guarantees longevity on the scale of glacial times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot going on in terms of making data FAIR. It&rsquo;s a little easier for making documents
FAIR, like having PDFs findable. On the data level, it becomes a little bit more complicated. And I
think that we should strive to get as close as possible to get to FAIR, but it might not for be
feasible for every domain.&rdquo;</p>

This record would certainly support &ndash; via a simple qualified reference &ndash; the operation of
accessing the identified object&rsquo;s value-obvious situational information, i.e. the raw byte sequence.
Crucially, the identifier record would also support &ndash; again, via simple qualified references &ndash;
operations to access methodological (still value-obvious to certain consumers) and more
philosophical (epistemic, ontological, axiological &ndash; value typically not obvious) information:</p>

three subtypes: syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Syntax</em>: Rules about what&rsquo;s grammatically well-formed. Example: A <code>CalculateAqueousStability</code>
command may have a set of atomic-composition pairs and a set of ion-concentration pairs. An
atomic-composition pair is a string paired with a number between 0 and 1. An ion-concentration pair
is a string paired with a number.</p>
<p><em>Semantics</em>: Rules about what may be syntactically valid but is nonetheless nonsense. Example: A
<code>CalculateAqueousStability</code> command may be syntactically valid, but it&rsquo;s compositions don&rsquo;t add up
to 1, the ion concentrations are physically implausible, etc.</p>
<p><em>Pragmatics</em>: Rules about contextual appropriateness for processing a syntactically and semantically
valid message. Example: an online system can&rsquo;t efficiently calculate stability for a system of more
than 4 atomic elements on-the-fly, so this kind of command is rejected.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Content classification is the most fundamental form of holistic content understanding. It helps make
your resources findable (<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F2">F2</a>) and connects them to other
resources (<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I3">I3</a>).</p>
<p>Content understanding represents each piece of content in the index. Relevance of content is a
function of query and content understanding. Query understanding represents each search query as a
search intent.</p>
<p>Classification maps a document to one or more predefined categories. We can do so using hand-tuned
rules or machine learning.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The categories can be a flat list, or they can be arranged in a
hierarchical (single-hierarchy or faceted) taxonomy<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If the categories are hierarchical and broadly applicable
(<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/I1">I1</a>), then a classifier might take advantage of the
hierarchy and more confidently map content to a non-leaf category (e.g., mapping a material to
“Semiconductor” rather than “High-Gap Semiconductor” or “III-V Semiconductor”). In general, it’s
best to map value objects and entities to leaf categories.</p>
<p>Reducing the number of labels substantially improves the precision of a classifier. But filtering
out infrequent labels decreases coverage, and it’s not clear that out-of-scope examples will be
recognized in production.(<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F4">F4</a>) A more robust approach is
to leverage the hierarchical nature of a taxonomy and roll up infrequently used labels to their
parent or other ancestor categories.</p>

<p>If you have a category taxonomy and labeled queries, you can train a classifier in order to
dynamically assign a category to a query. A benefit of taxonomic hierarchy is that, while a labeled
query may be labeled with a leaf node of the taxonomy, you can prune, i.e. &ldquo;roll up&rdquo;, the taxonomy
to ensure sufficient signal for training. This helps to maintain

<![CDATA[<p>Have you ever set an objective function for code refactoring, where, for every proposed total change
(e.g. reviewable pull request), you seek to maximize the change in this function? An example:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>\[ \log_2(pct_{LOC\<em>tested})  * pct</em>{importables\<em>documented} * pct</em>{LOC\<em>nostate} \over n</em>{LOC} \]</p>
<p>Good (numerator stuff):</p>
<ul>
<li>Percent Lines of Code (LOC) covered by a test. Sublinear growth here, i.e. diminishing returns on &ldquo;getting to 100%&rdquo;. An off-the-shelf tool like <a href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/">Coverage.py</a> will be fine here.</li>
<li>Percent &ldquo;public&rdquo; units, i.e. non-underscored module importables - functions, classes, constants, variables/objects, covered by <a href="https://diataxis.fr/">tutorial/how-to-guide/explanation (so excluding reference) documentation</a>. Maximizes code consumers&rsquo; ability to understand functionality without have to dive into the codebase. Prior art on measuring this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2018/Jul/28/documentation-unit-tests/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Percent LOC unaffected by state (i.e. avoiding getting values from or calling methods on long-living references). Pure-functional code is easier to reason about (e.g. via a simple <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node10.html">substitution mode of execution</a>) and thus more maintainable. My strategy for measuring this would be to designate certain (sub)packages/modules as purely functional.</li>

<![CDATA[<!-- KaTeX block: \\[ x \rightarrow y \\] -->
<!-- KaTeX inline: \\( x \rightarrow y \\) -->
<p>I am beginning to walk through each <a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Question">question</a> of the
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology">FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) Ontology</a>. My goal
is to construct and share a populated model of people&rsquo;s articulations &ndash; aka
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Declaration">declarations</a> &ndash; of choices they&rsquo;ve made or with
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-No-Choice-Declaration">challenges</a> they face with regard to
addressing each question, as well as the
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/considerations">considerations</a> they associate with any such choice
or challenge.</p>
<p>The first question for which <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/fip-question-f1/">I&rsquo;m seeking
declarations</a> is
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Question-F1-D">F1-D</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What globally unique, persistent, resolvable identifiers do you use for datasets?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten some great responses so far, mostly
about people choosing to use the <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-handle-system-of-persistent-identifiers/">Handle (incl.
DOI)</a> or
<a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-ark-system-of-pids/">ARK</a> systems.</p>
<p>I got a great question from my former group-mate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shyam-dwaraknath/">Shyam
Dwaraknath</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end these are all just persistent URLs no?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For all intents and purposes, <em>yes</em>. Practically, if you don&rsquo;t give someone a resolving<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> HTTP(S)
URL, such that they can Locate and retrieve the Resource given a Uniform Identifier (i.e.,
URI\(\implies\)URL), they should be able to straightforwardly construct one.</p>
<p>Handles and ARKs use their compact forms to communicate</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>an intention of persistence, and (related to this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a URL-construction protocol in case they are</p>
<p>(a) not communicated as URLs, or</p>
<p>(b) they are, but the URLs don&rsquo;t resolve.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you see e.g. <code>10.1038/sdata.2016.18</code> somewhere, the hope is you will grok that
the <code>\d+[\.\d+]+/.+</code> pattern (period-delimited numbers, then a <code>/</code>, then stuff) is likely a Handle,
so you will try putting <a href="https://doi.org/">https://doi.org/</a> or <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/">https://hdl.handle.net/</a> before it. There either need to
be well-known public Handle HTTP Proxy servers, or you search around for &ldquo;Handle proxy server&rdquo;.
You&rsquo;ll also see <code>doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18</code> sometimes. Same principle. The hope is you know how to
URLify it trivially.</p>
<p>The form of an ARK is similar in intent. The hope is that if you see e.g. <code>ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045</code>
somewhere (for ARKs, the <code>ark:</code> prefix is part of the ID form, even in URL paths), you&rsquo;ll think
&ldquo;this ID is intended to be persistent &ndash; an archival resource key&rdquo; and &ldquo;I hope some name mapping
authority (NMA) is publicly resolving <code>ark:57802</code> IDs&rdquo;. The well-known public ARK HTTP Proxy is
<a href="https://n2t.net">https://n2t.net</a>, and e.g. <a href="https://n2t.net/ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045">https://n2t.net/ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045</a> passes through to
<a href="https://ns.polyneme.xyz/ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045">https://ns.polyneme.xyz/ark:57802/dw0/agu/6045</a> because <code>https://ns.polyneme.xyz</code> is registered
there as the NMA for the name assigning authority (NAA) <code>ark:57802</code>.</p>
<p>Other persistent ID systems that imply/offer HTTP URLs have tighter coupling to the DNS domain
responsible for resolving the IDs. Some of these systems are intended for general use, such as
<a href="https://purl.org/">https://purl.org/</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/">https://w3id.org/</a>.</p>
<p>In these systems, prefixes are not <em>allocated</em> like with Handles or ARKs, and there is no emphasis
on prefixes being semantically opaque so as to increase the likelihood of continued commitment to
persistence if/when stewarding organizations change names. Rather, prefixes are <em>claimed</em>, like
<a href="http://purl.org/dc">http://purl.org/dc</a> (serving e.g. <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms">http://purl.org/dc/terms</a>) and <a href="https://purl.org/dw">https://purl.org/dw</a> (serving
e.g. <a href="https://purl.org/dw/squirrel">https://purl.org/dw/squirrel</a>), or <a href="https://w3id.org/nmdc">https://w3id.org/nmdc</a> (where currently, all path
extensions, e.g. <a href="https://w3id.org/nmdc/nmdc-schema">https://w3id.org/nmdc/nmdc-schema</a>, resolve to the same page).</p>
<p>Other DNS-coupled systems are socially positioned as providing specific types of persistent
identifiers. Such systems include the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <a href="https://w3.org/">https://w3.org/</a> namespace
for standards (e.g. <a href="https://w3.org/ns/dcat">https://w3.org/ns/dcat</a>), the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)
<a href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a> (e.g. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8424-0604">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8424-0604</a>), the International Generic
Sample Number (IGSN) <a href="https://igsn.org">https://igsn.org</a> (e.g. <a href="https://igsn.org/IEWFS0001">https://igsn.org/IEWFS0001</a>), and the Research
Organization Registry (ROR) <a href="https://ror.org/">https://ror.org/</a> (e.g. <a href="https://ror.org/02jbv0t02">https://ror.org/02jbv0t02</a>).</p>
<p>If/when any such special-purpose, domain-name-tied system cannot fulfill persistence, it is hoped
that there will be (a) an adopter organization and (b) sufficient signage (e.g. minimal maintenance
of the old domain as a static notice) to enable programmatic workarounds, like the case of the
Global Researcher Identifier Database (GRID) <a href="https://grid.ac/">https://grid.ac/</a> being passed to ROR for stewardship.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://arks.org/">Archival Resource Key (ARK) system</a> is an alternative to the <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-handle-system-of-persistent-identifiers/">Handle
system</a> to satisfy
<a href="https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/F1">FAIR&rsquo;s F1 Principle</a>.</p>
<p>Similar to the Handle system, naming authority for ARKs is distributed by allotting prefixes.
However, there is no &ldquo;pre-prefix&rdquo; administration via a small number of credentialed multi-primary
administrators, and there is currently no fee per allotted prefix, called a Name Assigning Authority
Number (NAAN).</p>
<p>Another difference between the Handle and ARK system is in distinguishing between a name assigning
authority (NAA), i.e. identifier minting, and a name mapping authority (NMA), i.e. identifier
resolution. With the Handle system, NAA and NMA functions are administered by the same organization.
With the ARK system, an NAA may be its own NMA, may migrate from one NMA to another, or may have
multiple NMA service providers.</p>
<p>For more on ARKs, see my post on <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/object-persistence-a-matter-of-service/">Object Persistence: A Matter of
Service</a>, the most recent
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kunze-ark/34/">specification</a>, and the <a href="https://arks.org/">ARK
Alliance</a> website.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The Handle system is a popular choice for the assignment and resolution of globally unique,
persistent identifiers. Governance is centralized with the <a href="https://www.dona.net/">DONA Foundation</a>,
and administration is distributed among so-called <a href="https://www.dona.net/mpas">Credentialed Multi-Primary Administrators
(MPAs)</a>, of which there are currently nine. You&rsquo;ve likely heard of at
least one MPA: the <a href="https://www.doi.org/">International DOI Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Each MPA is assigned a number. The DOI Foundation has <code>10</code>. This is why all DOIs begin with <code>10.</code>.
Each MPA can in turn give a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; prefix (everything before the <code>/</code>) to a so-called &ldquo;naming
authority&rdquo;. The DOI Foundation<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> gave the <a href="https://www.nature.com/">Nature Publishing Group</a> (now
<a href="https://www.springernature.com/">Springer Nature</a>) <code>10.1038</code>, for example, who in turn can create
as many local names as they&rsquo;d like, such as <code>10.1038/sdata.2016.18</code>.</p>
<p>How do handles get resolved? Each handle prefix may have its own administrator, and administration
of handles is distributed, similar to the Domain Name System (DNS). The Handle system is compatible
with DNS, but does not require it. In practice, there are known public HTTP proxy servers such as
<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/">https://hdl.handle.net/</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/">https://doi.org/</a> that allow resolution of handles as URLs. Hence,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18">https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18</a> is resolvable.</p>
<p>Another big MPA is the <a href="https://cnri.net/">Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI)</a>.
CNRI governed the Handle system before passing it off to the formed-for-this-purpose DONA Foundation
in 2015. Before this, CNRI assigned MPA-esque numbers to a bunch of organizations, and these
continue to be administered by the CNRI-as-MPA, even though it&rsquo;s assigned number is <code>20</code> now. For
example, CNRI assigned <code>1721.1</code> to <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, which is used for it&rsquo;s
<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/">DSpace</a> repository. My PhD thesis was assigned <code>1721.1/71495</code>. So,
<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/71495">https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/71495</a> and  <a href="https://doi.org/1721.1/71495">https://doi.org/1721.1/71495</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (and
<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/71495">https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/71495</a>) all get you to it.</p>
<p>You can inspect Handle prefix records, which are analogous to DNS records, via
<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/">https://hdl.handle.net/</a>. For example, <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1">https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1</a> lets you know that this
prefix is administered by MIT DSpace via the CNRI MPA (see the <code>/20.ADMIN</code>-containing <code>HS_ADMIN</code>
entry).</p>
<p>So how do you start minting and resolving Handles?</p>
<p>Become a credentialed MPA? I don&rsquo;t know, that seems hard for an individual researcher. There are
only nine <a href="https://www.dona.net/mpas">credentialed by DONA</a>.</p>
<p>Request a completed prefix from an existing MPA, e.g. something that matches <code>10.\d+</code> from the DOI
foundation? Yes, you can do that. MPAs typically charge registration and annual service fees per
allotted prefix (i.e., the whole <code>.</code>-delimited number before the <code>/</code> in a handle). In the case of
the DOI Foundation, they delegate to e.g. <a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> to assign <code>10.</code>
prefixes. In this case, for additional <a href="https://www.crossref.org/fees/">fees</a>, Crossref will resolve
identifiers for you (beyond assigning you a prefix to mint as many as you&rsquo;d like).</p>
<p>A final method is to find a service provider that has a complete prefix and will let you mint
handles under their prefix, or will mint them for you. This is the most typical route for
researchers. For example, <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a> got <code>10.5281</code> from
<a href="https://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> (another <code>10.\d+</code> service provider the DOI Foundation delegates
to), and they&rsquo;ll give you a full handle when you upload stuff to <a href="https://zenodo.org">https://zenodo.org</a>.
<a href="https://www.researchequals.com">ResearchEquals</a> got <code>10.53962</code> from CrossRef, and they&rsquo;ll give you
one for anything you put on <a href="https://www.researchequals.com/">https://www.researchequals.com/</a>. And of course, journal publishers
typically give you one when you publish an article with them.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-item_search">known-item search</a>, and discoverability to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_search">exploratory search</a>.</p>
<p>Known-item search is compatible with &ldquo;instant search&rdquo;, aka search-as-you-type interfaces.
Exploratory search is compatible with &ldquo;autocomplete&rdquo; (incl. re-spelling, infix matching, synonym

<p>Recommendation can be a part of exploratory search, i.e. bundled in response to a user&rsquo;s pulling for
relevant information. It can also be pushed independently of deliberately registered search intent
&ndash; via notifications, email digests, etc.</p>
<p>Does the latter activity &ndash; the pushy one &ndash;  &ldquo;count&rdquo; for discoverability? I can imagine such
activity being framed as periodic re-running of an exploratory-search query on behalf of a user,
with query-independent factors for retrieval and ranking being varied over time.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Is an ontology &ldquo;better&rdquo; than a relational data model?
&ldquo;More expressive power&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t always mean &ldquo;better&rdquo;.
However, ontologies allow you to ratchet up power while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">keeping logic in data structures</a>.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;relational data model&rdquo;, folks typically mean &ldquo;SQL model&rdquo;.
In the RDF world, this is roughly on par with a SHACL model, i.e. a model that expresses constraints on the shapes of entities and on the so-called &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; types of their properties/attributes/columns/fields (string, boolean, integer, etc.).
Both SHACL and SQL can set the ranges of properties to be &ldquo;reference&rdquo; types, which is indirect in SQL through primitive-typed (usually an integer or string) foreign keys.</p>
<p>An ontology language allows for more expressive data modeling than shape and attribute validation, while staying at the level of declarative data description.
In the RDF world, OWL lets you express notions of commonality and variability familiar from object-oriented programming such as classes, subclasses, and properties &ndash; you don&rsquo;t need a software-defined object-relational mapping (ORM) layer.
You can also express certain constraints for and between classes, entities (individuals), and properties.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing you can express using ontologies that you cannot also express using a SQL data model plus a general programming language, or just a programming language.
So why declaratively model data at all? Why SQL then and not just CSV files if you&rsquo;re going to load the data into Python et al. anyway?
The rule of least power (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power</a>).
Ontology languages give you more expressive power than shape-constraint languages while reducing the risk of non-reusability of your modeling logic for unforeseen applications.</p>

Zenodo and Zotero.</p>
<p>Already have a DOI? <a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format#tools-to-work-with-citationcff-files-wrench">Let&rsquo;s see about a DOI-to-CFF
tool</a>.
Looks like there&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/citation-file-format/doi2cff">doi2cff</a>, but it&rsquo;s currently
restricted to DOIs on Zenodo that are tagged as software releases.</p>
<p>So, this could work:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>pip install git+https://github.com/citation-file-format/doi2cff
doi2cff init 10.5281/zenodo.6591863
</code></pre><pre tabindex="0"><code>CITATION.cff file has been written
</code></pre><p>Cool. But what if you want to cite something else? Let&rsquo;s go from DOI to BibTeX, and BibTeX to CFF.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get BibTeX via <a href="https://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html#sec-4">content negotiation</a>:</p>

</code></pre><p>Sweet. There is a command-line tool for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cffconvert/">converting CFF to other common
formats</a>, but that&rsquo;s not what we want here. Ah, here we go:
<a href="https://github.com/monperrus/bibtexbrowser/">bibtex-to-cff</a>.</p>
<p>To save you a bit of hassle, I&rsquo;ve packaged this PHP tool as a Docker image,
<code>polyneme/bibtex-to-cff</code>. Also, it can&rsquo;t (currently) handle URLs as BibTeX entry ids, so for this
case I changed <code>@article{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5570279,</code> in the above example to
<code>@article{10.5281.zenodo.5570279,</code> (it seems fine with periods).</p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>docker run --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app/scratch \
    polyneme/bibtex-to-cff \
    scratch/refs.bib --id 10.5281.zenodo.5570279 \
    &gt; CITATION.cff
</code></pre><p>Done. Add this to the root of your git repo, and congratulate yourself for including
machine-actionable citation metadata with your software.</p>
<p>You can build the image yourself by cloning the <code>monperrus/bibtexbrowser</code> GitHub repo, adding the
following to a new <code>Dockerfile</code> in the repo directory:</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Datasets are easier to reuse if they use standards that are well-established, particularly in a given domain.</p>
<p>A first approach is to ask around &ndash; ask people with whom you coauthor , people you trust in your field, etc.</p>
<p>A follow-on approach is to examine the &ldquo;graph reputation&rdquo; of relevant standards, particularly if they may be represented as resources with outbound links. We can use the PageRank algorithm, just like Google uses it to index the web of documents.</p>
<p>An an example, here I outline an initial approach to find the &ldquo;most reputable&rdquo; of <a href="https://lov.linkeddata.es/">Linked Open Vocabularies&rsquo;</a> 778 vocabularies.</p>
<p>My starting point is having the API responses for each vocabulary so that <code>lov</code> is a list of <code>dict</code>s, each with keys <code>url: str</code> and <code>api_response: dict</code>.</p>

</code></pre><p>We can see at a glance the &ldquo;most reputable&rdquo; vocabularies, and they don&rsquo;t surprise me. What may be more helpful is to collect candidate vocabularies for your domain and focus on their relative scores in order to gauge whether any are &ldquo;well-established&rdquo; in a sense. Even more helpful may be to include multiple &ldquo;types&rdquo; of resources &ndash; with standards linking to and being linked from various databases and policies. <a href="https://fairsharing.org/">FAIRSharing</a> seems like it could eventually support open investigation of the latter kind.</p>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">Lean manufacturing</a> aims to reduce waste in
production processes and to reduce response times to consumers from producers.</p>
<p>Womack and Jones<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> authored five key principles for lean thinking in the context of manufacturing:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Value</em>: Identify the value of a product to a consumer.</li>
<li><em>Value Stream</em> - Identify the minimal process (steps, time, information, material) to produce the value.</li>
<li><em>Flow</em>: Make production flow through the steps.</li>
<li><em>Pull</em>: Pull between the steps (rather than pushing intermediate &ldquo;inventory&rdquo; that may not be used).</li>
<li><em>Perfection</em>: Reduce the number of steps and the amount of time, information, and material needed for production.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">Lean software development</a> aims to adapt
lean thinking to software development.</p>
<p>The Poppendiecks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> authored seven principles that don&rsquo;t directly provide qualified references to
Womack and Jones&rsquo; principles. Here, I attempt to align their principles of software development to
the framework and terminology of Womack and Jones&rsquo;s lean thinking principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Evaluate Late</em>: Decide on the end-value of a product to a consumer as late as possible. There is
one value stream option per end-value option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mind Value Stream Multiplicity and Looping</em>: With one value stream per end-value hypothesis, can
value streams share structure to eliminate waste? Value streams may have loops (iterations) that
must be particularly lean to support a high learning rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Flow</em>: Make production flow for fast delivery and thus for rapid learning given the presence of
loops in a value stream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pull</em>: Pulling between steps empowers the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Perfection</em>: Continuous refactoring facilitates ensuring integrity and optimizing the whole.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, I can couch a conceptualization of lean principles for web development, i.e. Lean Web
principles, with clear lineage to the lean thinking principles for manufacturing and through lean
principles for software development:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Evaluate Resources Late</em>: Deal in data for as long as possible. Apply transformation logic later
&ndash; there are many applications. Apply presentation logic even later &ndash; there are many modes of
consumption for an application. See also: Perlis&rsquo; epigram<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>: &ldquo;Functions delay binding;
data structures induce binding. Moral: Structure data late in the programming process.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mind Value Stream Multiplicity and Looping</em>: Eliminate waste in process steps, time, information
(configuration / manual signaling), and material (code, data, storage/compute infrastructure).
Can web dev processes share logic? Pay particular attention to waste in value stream loops
(iterations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Flow</em>: Choose continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pull</em>: Choose distributed version control for code, data, and storage/compute
infrastructure (as code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Perfection</em>: Can it all fit in your head, to facilitate conceptual integrity and strategic
refactoring?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I am well aware of <a href="https://gomakethings.com/about/">Chris Ferdinandi</a> and his excellent
exposition on <a href="https://leanweb.dev/">Lean Web thinking</a> and associated <a href="https://leanweb.dev/ebook/lean-web-principles/">three
principles</a>. Here&rsquo;s how I think his principles may
map to those above:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Embrace the Platform</em>: This relates to evaluating resources late. Can you exchange data as RDF
(e.g. serialized as JSON-LD) over HTTP? Can you exchange logic for inference and validation as RDF
data as well, via the RDFS/OWL and SHACL standards of the Web platform? Can you exchange logic for
presentation as HTML (templates) and CSS? If your front-end requires operational processes, can that
be done using vanilla JavaScript?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Small and Modular</em>: This relates to minding value stream multiplicity and looping. There is a
lot of opportunity to eliminate waste and reuse functionality (especially functionality provided by
the platform!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Web is for Everyone</em>: This relates to evaluating resources late (why prematurely optimize
for applications and consumption use cases and thus exclude potential stakeholders?) and pulling
(empower people by encouraging them to pull rather than telling them to pick up whatever is pushed).</p>
</li>

<![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Dataset&rdquo; is a derived notion, a psychological construct, where &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of the dataset are a succession of values that we perceive to be causally related. &ldquo;Dataset&rdquo; is a side effect.</p>
<p>Consider Rich Hickey&rsquo;s epochal time model, which I have <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-materials-paradigm-and-epochal-time/">written about previously</a>:</p>
<p><img
src="https://donnywinston.com/img/hickey_are-we-there-yet_epochal-time-model.jpg"
alt="Epochal time model, from Rich Hickey's 'Are We There Yet' talk"
title="Epochal time model, from Rich Hickey's 'Are We There Yet' talk"
width="70%"></p>
<p>Identity is a derived notion, a collecting of values and calling each value a “state”. A state is just a labeling of a value for an identity at a point in &ldquo;time&rdquo;. The succession of states is the identity. Identity is a side effect of choosing a timeline of value succession.</p>
<p>Consider drawing a dotted line on the figure above that encompasses all of the immutable values (boxes) and all of the ovals (pure functions). This may be considered the <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#functional">functional</a> <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#phase">phase</a> of a <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#process">process</a>, where data is <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#transform">transformed</a> (<a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#accrete">accreted</a>, <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#reduce">reduced</a>, or <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#reshape">reshaped</a>), separate from the <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#operational">operational</a> (i.e., <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#pull">pull</a> or <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#push">push</a>) phases of that process.</p>
<p>With this perspective, a process&rsquo;s functional phase also suggests labeling its succession of values. Each value may be called “data”. That is, a value becomes data when it is an input or output for a process. Depending on where the value is in the topology of the process, it may be considered “raw data” or “derived data” with respect to that process.</p>
<p>What, then, may we call the succession of data values for the timeline of a process &ndash; what is the &ldquo;identity&rdquo; here, where successive values are &ldquo;states&rdquo;? In the <a href="https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/blob/3808d4ab7dc0229c0f7997eda49fc00ab3947f26/spec/OpenLineage.md#openlineage-spec">OpenLineage specification</a>, the name for this identity is &ldquo;dataset&rdquo;. In the <a href="https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez/blob/c53f66c0a3f748742eea69db5f3c287c63c929a9/docs/index.md#data-model">Marquez reference implementation</a> of OpenLineage, a &ldquo;dataset version&rdquo; is a read-only, immutable version of a dataset, i.e. an immutable value in the sense of the epochal time model.</p>
<p>Thus, &ldquo;dataset versions&rdquo; are the states, and &ldquo;datasets&rdquo; the identities, for the succession of values associated with the functional phase of a process.  To the extent that an immutable digital object &ndash; a value &ndash; is useful in the functional phase of one or more processes, it is useful to identify it as a &ldquo;dataset version&rdquo;. To the extent that a succession of such values, which we perceive to be causally related via a process, is useful in whole or in part to various timelines of various processes, it is useful to identify this succession as a &ldquo;dataset&rdquo;.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) publishes a range of specifications and guidelines which help move web standards forward.</p>
<p>However, even when restricting scope to the Latest version of specifications with the status Recommendation and with the tag Data, there are currently 77 of them: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/?tag=data&amp;status=REC&amp;version=latest">https://www.w3.org/TR/?tag=data&amp;status=REC&amp;version=latest</a>!</p>
<p>I read through the listing, and here I try to categorize and present a subset of the specifications that I think are most relevant to scientific data management:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>description representations, i.e. formal ways to define and communicate data, metadata, and queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</li>
<li>SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>description metamodels, i.e. formal ways to define and communicate models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)</li>
<li>Relational Database to RDF Mapping Language (R2RML)</li>
<li>RDF Schema</li>
<li>Web Ontology Language (OWL)</li>
<li>Rule Interchange Format (RIF)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>description models, i.e. models that may be applied directly or may serve as umbrellas for more specialized models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT)</li>
<li>Provenance Data Model (PROV)</li>
<li>Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)</li>
<li>CSV for the Web (CSVW)</li>
<li>RDF Data Cube Vocabulary</li>
<li>Organization Ontology</li>
<li>Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have left out specifications for serialization, i.e. the text-based appearance of things when viewing/editing them and their formats as files as disk.</p>
<p>Still, 14 specifications is a lot! I&rsquo;ve tried to list them out in each category in order of roughly decreasing &ldquo;bang for your learning buck&rdquo; for typical use cases I&rsquo;ve encountered.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear from you which, if any, of the specifications above you&rsquo;ve found useful and/or which you would like to know better (or at all!).</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I noticed a pattern at the top of each case study listed by <a href="https://www.stemma.ai">Stemma.ai</a>,
which provides data catalog software as a service based on the open-source
<a href="https://www.amundsen.io/">Amundsen</a> code. Each case study&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;Data Stack&rdquo; comprises up to
four distinct categories of functionality &ndash; Data Catalog, Data Warehouse, ETL, and Business
Intelligence.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Data Stack&rdquo; for each case study:

<li>An ETL platform, aka a Data Orchestration<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> platform, is about making data <em>Interoperable</em>.</li>
<li>A Business Intelligence (BI) tool is about making data <em>Reusable</em>, aka Repurposeable.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s encouraging to see high-level alignment between the FAIR Principles and a conceptualization of useful enterprise data systems in the corporate world.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been recording introductions to each of the 15 FAIR Principles and releasing them as episodes of my Machine-Centric Science podcast (<a href="https://podcast.polyneme.xyz/">https://podcast.polyneme.xyz/</a>).</p>
<p>I just released the 13th one, featuring an overview of various data and code licenses. <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/ad7b9725">Listen here</a>.</p>
<p>Full transcript below (but also linked to via the episode landing page):</p>
<p>======</p>
<p>Hello, and welcome to Machine-Centric Science. My name is Donny Winston, and I&rsquo;m here to talk about the FAIR principles in practice for scientists who want to compound to their impacts, not their errors. Today, we&rsquo;re going to be talking about the 13th of the 15 FAIR principles, R1.1: metadata and data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.</p>
<p>The license may be different for a data resource and the metadata that describes it. This has implications for indexing of the metadata and findability as well as ultimately using the data. It highlights the need to separate and permalink the data and the metadata.</p>
<p>By default, resources cannot be legally used without clarity in licensing. And furthermore, a license that cannot be found by an agent, a computational agent, is effectively the same as no license at all in a world of automated search and discovery.</p>
<p>There are lots of options in the world of licensing. I will go over the Creative Commons suite of data licenses, and I&rsquo;ll also go over some code licenses, and relations between them.</p>
<p>Starting from most open, with Creative Commons, there&rsquo;s CC0, no rights reserved.</p>
<p>After that, we have CC BY &ndash; by Attribution. This license lets others distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. It&rsquo;s the most accommodating of licenses offered that still require attribution.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there&rsquo;s the CC BY SA &ndash; attribution and share-alike. This license let&rsquo;s others use your work, even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you. And also they need to license their new creations under identical terms. So all new works based on the work will carry the same license. The attribution share-alike is the license used by Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Closing up things a bit, we have attribution-no-derivatives, CC BY ND. This license lets others reuse the work for any purpose, including commercially. However, it cannot shared with others in adapted form, so you can&rsquo;t make any changes.</p>
<p>Closing things up a bit more there&rsquo;s attribution, but noncommercial, so you can use the stuff, but non-commercially. You can provide derivative works, but the derivative work that&rsquo;s distributed has to be non-commercial.</p>
<p>Further down the line there&rsquo;s attribution non-commercial share-alike. This lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under identical terms.</p>
<p>And finally, attribution, non-commercial, no-derivatives just allows people to download the work, share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can&rsquo;t change the work in any way or use it commercially.</p>
<p>So, those are the Creative Commons licenses typically use for data. Then there are the code licenses, and these aren&rsquo;t quite along the same spectrum of open to closed. Rather, the spectrum is more going from maximizing user freedom to maximizing redistributor freedom.</p>
<p>The most user-free license that I&rsquo;ve encountered recently that&rsquo;s in popular use is the Server Side Public License that&rsquo;s in use by, say, MongoDB. And this is akin to the Creative Commons attribution share-alike license, but additional sharing. So if someone&rsquo;s offering this software as a managed service, they have to supply the source code and they also have to supply the source code for all of the service tooling that&rsquo;s helping them to provide that service, like managed backups, et cetera. So, it goes even beyond the actual code. So it really makes sure that whoever is using the software really can reproduce the use. And so that maximizes that.</p>
<p>A little bit less than that, keeping to the domain of the actual code itself is the Affero GPL, the AGPL. That&rsquo;s more akin to CC attribution share-alike, where even if you&rsquo;re distributing the code through a service online, through a managed service, and you&rsquo;re not actually distributing the source code directly, you still have to supply the source code to the users.</p>
<p>Okay, going down, there&rsquo;s then the GPL, the GNU Public License. Here, if you&rsquo;re offering the software as a service, you don&rsquo;t have to include source modifications &ndash; it&rsquo;s only if you&rsquo;re actually distributing the source code.</p>
<p>Then, we have some licenses that are more compartmentalized to the actual portions of the code that&rsquo;s being reused. So there&rsquo;s the Lesser GPL and the Mozilla Public License, which are, again, like Creative Commons with attribution and share-alike, but if those licensed components are combined with other software, the user does not have the right to have the source code for all the other components that are necessary to use the system. They only have the right to modifications made to your component that is under the Mozilla Public License or Lesser GPL. But there may be other parts of the software system, as distributed, that are protected, are proprietary.</p>
<p>So this kind of gives a bit more freedom to the redistributor if they have proprietary code that they want to mix in, or pair with, rather, the open software. So it kind of makes the user have a little bit less insight into the total software of the system, but they still have insight into your component that you&rsquo;ve released under LGPL or Mozilla Public License, MPL.</p>
<p>There is the Business Source License. This is kind of akin to a Creative Commons by attribution, noncommercial license that typically reverts to a by-attribution, commercial-okay license. So, Business Source License, like Sentry&rsquo;s monitoring service, has an Additional Use Grant, which says, you can use this however you want as long as you do not offer commercially a managed service. So only we, the company that makes this software, can offer a managed service where we offer this to third parties. But as a user, you can do whatever you want internally. You just can&rsquo;t also be a company that sells this software as a service to other companies.</p>
<p>So again, this offers a lot of user freedom, but has a bit more emphasis on redistributor freedom to clamp down on use. And Elasticsearch&rsquo;s Elastic License is similar in the sense that a user can sort of do whatever they want with it, but they&rsquo;re restricted from redistributing it commercially as a service.</p>
<p>Then, going down more towards freedom of the redistributor, we have things like the Apache 2.0 license, which is more like a Creative Commons with attribution, and also adds in some share-alike for contributions. So by default, anyone contributing to an Apache 2 codebase also grants their contributions to be distributed under the same license.</p>
<p>And then, the most so-called permissive licenses are things like the BSD license, Berkeley Software Distribution, and the MIT license, and those are more akin to just Creative Commons attribution. So there&rsquo;s really no other restrictions or conditions on use, about things that are analogous to share-alike or non-commercial or non-derivative or you can&rsquo;t offer this as a managed service, or if you do, you need to offer all of the code for your associated tooling for the service. It kind of places the most freedom on someone who has the software and is wanting to redistribute it or repurpose it in some way. So those are generally going to be the most compatible options with everything else.</p>
<p>One other license I wanted to bring up a bit just in the context of this podcast and science &ndash; there&rsquo;s a fun license called the CRAPL. And it&rsquo;s a quote unquote academic-strength open-source license. I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily recommend it, but I want to bring it in here just so that I can compare it to some of the other licenses that I&rsquo;ve mentioned.</p>
<p>In the software world, I would say that the CRAPL is similar to a Business Source License with no Change License &ndash; a business source license, normally after a certain period, like two or three years, will turn into a much more permissive license, so it will become actually Open in the sense of the Open Source Initiative. And the CRAPL has the Additional Use Grant, in the context of a Business Source License, that it is only for validating published claims and validating pre-publication claims. And furthermore, the use grant allows one to publish those claims on the conditions that (1) the original author is notified of the use and claims prior to submission, and (2) that those modifications are released under the CRAPL when the supporting claims are publicly released, say, in a publication.</p>
<p>So, this is also kind of like the Creative Commons by attribution, non-commercial, share-alike, with the additional condition that a good faith attempt is made to notify the original author prior to public claims and distribution of your modifications.</p>
<p>So in summary, there are a bunch of widely used licenses. Popular licenses in the data world are the Creative Commons suite. Popular licenses in the code world are things like Apache 2.0, BSD, MIT, Mozilla Public License, the GPL &ndash; Lesser, Affero &ndash; and also newer ones that extend the others to noncommercial restrictions, like the Business Source License and the Server Side Public License, or, rather, conditions on commercial use.</p>
<p>If your data and metadata are not covered clearly and accessibly by one of these licenses, or if there are additional restrictions, if those aren&rsquo;t clearly and accessibly provided, then reuse of your data is going to be jeopardized.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be it for today. I&rsquo;m Donny Winston and I hope you join me again next time for Machine-Centric Science.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>What is that strange possession that stays the same throughout its life?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Can we recollect how things appeared to us before we learned to link new meanings to those things?</p>
<p>What is this body of changelessness in spite of change?</p>
<p>Perhaps the purview of a thing&rsquo;s persistence is its predictable pathways of provenance:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>the typical effects of its typical activities,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li>its body of influenc(ed/ing) entities<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> whose meanings change only slowly, and</li>
<li>whichever of its agents<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> change the least as its life proceeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data does not have intrinsic meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The semantics of our data are defined by the effects it produces when passed into our functions. These effects should be predictable whenever possible, but data cannot prevent itself from being interpreted in surprising ways.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An identifier is an association between a string of data and an object.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The semantics of our identifiers are then defined by the effects produced by interpreters that believe records bearing witness to these associations.</p>
<p>A layer of indirection separates <em>what</em> something does from <em>how</em> it does it. Similarly, an identifier separates <em>what</em> something <em>is</em> from <em>how</em> it is.</p>
<p>What are some tools for predictability in indirection?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>referential transparency</em>: The semantics of purely functional code will remain the same if we replace every expression with its result, e.g. &ldquo;1 + 1&rdquo; with &ldquo;2&rdquo; (for typical senses of &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;+&rdquo;, and &ldquo;2&rdquo;!).</li>
<li><em>invariant relations</em>: The semantics of a data structure&rsquo;s interface &ndash; its abstract representation, its exposed behavior &ndash; will remain the same if we decide to change its concrete representation &ndash; its internal model &ndash; as long as we enforce appropriate invariant relations on that concrete representation.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Effects are the currency of meaning, yet their causes and conditions are ever fleeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;everything in the world is the result of a vast concurrence of causes and conditions, and everything disappears as these causes and conditions change and pass away.</p>
<p>&ndash; Buddha<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All models are wrong, but some are useful.&rdquo; An identity is ultimately a model, an abstract description that hides certain details while illuminating others, that can yield useful predictions when it provides adequate explanations relating primitive phenomena to one another and to more complex phenomena. Go forth and identify.</p>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Why is there not just one metadata format for all kinds of research / data?</p>
<p>&ndash; asked on <a href="https://fairdataforum.org/t/fair-aware-tool-faq/479/3">fairdataforum.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Metadata modeling and formatting are separate concerns. It is reasonable that different scientific domains and studies within domains may have widely varying modeling concerns. Controlled vocabulary terms, validity constraints, and other metadata elements will surely vary and evolve over time.</p>
<p>What’s not as obvious is why different scientific domains and studies within domains would have different formatting concerns. Different software applications and tools may have their preferred metadata formats for operational convenience. Thus, as some software gains prominence in a specific domain, its preferred format may be adopted by other tools in the ecosystem for ease of exchange and integration.</p>
<p>For there to be a single metadata format that is universally adopted for metadata exchange — that is, a format that a given software tool may convert to a preferred internal format for convenience of use by the tool — that format would need to be able to communicate the model being used as well. Thus, the format would need to host a language for defining models.</p>
<p>There have been some efforts at this. One effort that has gained some recognition in the FAIR data community is that of the Semantic Web set of standards. Specifically, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) base model, exchanged using a handful of standardized plain-text formats such as JSON-LD, and using RDF-expressed modeling languages such as RDFS (RDF Schema), OWL (Web Ontology Language), and SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language), is one effort towards a universal “meta-model” for defining and exchanging metadata models along with the metadata itself, in plain-text formats that both humans and machines can interpret unambiguously, if only to convert metadata to preferred internal modeling languages and formats.</p>

<![CDATA[<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/reproducibility-phase-space-wSnbNlvjVR.png" alt="Phase Space of Reproducibility"></p>
<p>What does &ldquo;reproducible science&rdquo; encompass?</p>
<h2 id="a-tug-of-war">A tug-of-war</h2>
<p>Here is one decomposition into &ldquo;repeatability&rdquo;, &ldquo;reproducibility&rdquo;, and &ldquo;replicability&rdquo;:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Repeatability (Same team, same experimental setup)&hellip;Reproducibility (Different team, same experimental setup)&hellip;Replicability (Different team, different experimental setup)&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a conflicting account of the relationship between &ldquo;replicability&rdquo; and &ldquo;reproducibility&rdquo;:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;even if we can replicate the results of a paper, slightly altering the experimental setup could have dramatically different results. For these reasons, we don’t want to consider the authors code, as this could be a source of bias. We want to focus on the question of reproducibility, without wading into the murky waters of replication.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that ACM&rsquo;s &ldquo;replicability&rdquo; is Edward Raff&rsquo;s &ldquo;reproducibility&rdquo;, and vice versa. And the colloquial phrase &ldquo;repeat after me&rdquo; is at odds with ACM&rsquo;s &ldquo;repeatability&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="a-trip-to-the-dictionary">A trip to the dictionary</h2>
<p>Merriam-Webster<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> defines reproduction as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the process by which plants and animals give rise to offspring and which fundamentally consists of the segregation of a portion of the parental body by a sexual or an asexual process and its subsequent growth and differentiation into a new individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and reports the first known use in circa 1640, in the above sense.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me that reproduction subsumes replication — replication is a sub-type of reproduction where, subjective to an observer, the new individual is a replica — an indistinguishable image — of the parental body.</p>
<p>Repetition seems like the kind of reproduction where no material portion of a parental body is involved. “Repeat after me” is about a second agent observing the first agent and reproducing the output of the first agent without material reuse of a portion of the first agent’s material output.</p>
<p>Repetition is about following the same method but without using a seed from the original performance.</p>
<p>Reproduction of result, i.e. growth of a new individual, can occur / be attempted with or without repetition of method. With or without repeated method, the growth of a new individual from the seed may or may not be successful.</p>
<h2 id="repetition-of-methods-replication-of-results">Repetition of methods, replication of results</h2>
<p>Repetition seems method-focused (same activities) whereas replication seems result-focused (same outcomes).</p>
<p>A reproduction can be perceived as more or less a repetition of the original production activities, and can orthogonally be perceived as more or less a replication of the original production outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="reproduction--representation--repetition--replication">Reproduction = Representation + Repetition + Replication</h2>
<p>In terms of the W3C Provenance ontology&rsquo;s<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> core types of Agent, Activity, and Entity (diagram at top reproduced here):</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/reproducibility-phase-space-wSnbNlvjVR.png" alt="Phase Space of Reproducibility"></p>
<p>Reproducibility is the space. One axis is repeatability, i.e. “activity-dependent reproducibility”. Another axis is replicability, i.e. “entity-dependent reproducibility”. The final axis is “agent-dependent reproducibility”. For scientific reproducibility, we really (really) would like to ignore the Agent axis — sure, agent/representative identity is correlated with entity resourcing and activity resourcing capacity and skill in the real world, but we’d rather not consider it an independent axis.</p>
<p>Thus, we consider a scientific process reproducible in part by its repeatability (reproduction of activities) and its replicability (reproduction of entities - artifacts, results, outcomes). This seems subjective, But “up and to the right” in the figure above is what we seem to seek.</p>
<h2 id="how-repeatable-is-reproduction-how-replicable-is-it">How repeatable is reproduction? How replicable is it?</h2>
<p>Engineering emphasizes modeling for prediction, whereas science emphasizes modeling for explanation. Thus, while repeatability (same activities) may not be valued for outcome-focused reproducibility in engineering, repeatability is valued for activity-focused reproducibility in science, that is, for explainability in terms of causes and conditions.</p>
<h2 id="on-independent-reproduction">On independent reproduction</h2>
<p>While we can consciously seek repeatability and replicability in reproduction attempts, we also typically value so-called “independent” reproduction, where it seems the investigating agent(s) were either not aware of original activities or of original starter/intermediate/output entities, or both, and yet reproduced them anyhow.</p>
<p>The significance of independent reproduction is not so much for validity of reproduction as it is for assigning credit to discovery, but still, independent reproduction is often perceived as more valid due to a perceived reduction in risk of dishonest reporting.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>How can it be that complex, dynamic objects can be described by short and simple strings and words? We often seek:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Selectivity</em> &ndash; Our images are often falsely clear. We may think of an object&rsquo;s &ldquo;personality&rdquo; in terms of that which we can easily describe. We may set aside the rest for now as though it simply weren&rsquo;t there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Style</em> &ndash; To avoid making decisions we consider unimportant for now, we may develop policies that become systematic traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Predictability</em> &ndash; It&rsquo;s hard to maintain fruitful exchange without trust, so we may try to conform to expectations. To the extent we frame our images of producer/consumer systems in terms of traits, we teach our data to behave in accordance with those same traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Self-Reliance</em> &ndash; Imagined traits can, over time, make themselves actual because we must be able to predict outcomes of the use of our own data. This prediction becomes easier the more we simplify our models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to be able to trust our own data, logic, and presentation resources. One way to accomplish this is to think of these resources in terms of traits, and then proceed to train those dynamic resources to behave according to those immediate images.</p>
<p>Still, like a personality is merely the surface of a person, a schema is merely the surface of a dynamic digital object. What we call traits, properties, etc. are only the regularities we manage to perceive and deem worthy of systematizing at present.</p>
<p>We may not be able to &ldquo;pin down&rdquo; the traits of our digital resources because there are many processes and policies that don&rsquo;t yet show themselves directly in elicited behavior but that work behind the scenes and that may only become important to name and systematize later.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We often have sound practical reasons for making choices that have no reasons by themselves but have effects on larger scales.</p>
<p>Familiar styles make it easier for us to recognize and classify the things we see. For example, we may choose furniture according to systematic styles or fashions.</p>
<p>We protect ourselves from distractions by adopting uniform styles. For example, if every object in a room were interesting in itself, our furniture might occupy our minds too much.</p>
<p>Societies need rules that make no sense for individuals. For example, it makes no difference whether a single car drives on the left or on the right, but it makes all the difference when there are many cars!</p>
<p>It can save a lot of mental work if one makes each arbitrary choice the way one did before. The more difficult the decision, the more this policy can save. And there&rsquo;s a paradox:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more equally attractive two alternatives seem, the harder it can be to choose between them &ndash; no matter that, to the same degree, the choice can only matter less.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, it is helpful to take recourse in rules of style when we&rsquo;re fairly sure that further thought will just waste time. We should not abandon reasoning recklessly, but often, ordinary reasons cancel out, so it makes sense to use forms that lie beneath the surface of our thoughts &ndash; style, fashion, art &ndash; our &ldquo;taste&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When it comes to exchanging knowledge representations, you&rsquo;re inviting your recipients into rooms you&rsquo;ve curated &ndash; consider whether your arrangement of &ldquo;furniture&rdquo; there is adding value or distracting.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Regarding a resource &ndash; dataset, model, tool, standard, agent, etc. &ndash; as a single thing can be helpful: in allocating physical space, in dealing with privacy and responsibility, in de-confusing mental activity.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Are human mental processes actually clean &ldquo;streams of consciousness&rdquo;, or is narrative a tool used to “straighten things out”, to simplify the representation of what happened? Is there really a single pipeline of ideas that flow through a mind?</p>
<p>And is a straightened-out story faithful to &ldquo;raw&rdquo; observation, or was a schema employed, a design pattern, an archetype, such as The Hero’s Journey?</p>
<p>In computing, modeling a workflow as a single process, a sequence of actions, is easiest for us mentally. As opposed to multiple concurrent processes.</p>
<p>And yet it is often operationally helpful to support concurrency via resource properties like immutability, idempotence, etc., even if we later explain “what happened” &ndash; if we later communicate activity provenance to fellow human beings &ndash; as a single process, a story, a linear narrative.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Some questions may be pursued circularly, where for example you cannot find a final cause &ndash; you must ask, <em>What caused that cause?</em> Or you cannot find an ultimate goal &ndash; <em>Then what purpose does <strong>that</strong> serve?</em> Such loops can waste our time.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It is a form of self-control to establish ways to bottom out, to employ base cases to stop recursion. When a child repeatedly asks <em>Why?</em>, adults may employ <em>Just because!</em></p>
<p>Cultures establish ways to deal with the need for bottoming out such as branding with shame or taboo, cloaking in awe or mystery, and consensus. Cultures evolve institutions that adopt specific answers to circular questions and establish authority-schemes to enforce these beliefs.</p>
<p>One could complain that such establishments substitute dogma for reason and truth. But in exchange, they spare whole populations from wasting time in fruitless reason loops. Rather, minds can more productively work on problems that can be solved.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We often seek to &ldquo;straighten out&rdquo; a maze-like, loop-containing situation. We try to find a &ldquo;path&rdquo; through &ldquo;causal&rdquo; explanations that go in only one direction. Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are countless different types of networks that contain loops. But all networks that contain no loops are basically the same: each has the form of a simple chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any directed acyclic graph (DAG) can be linearized, i.e. topologically sorted. And we can apply the same types of reasoning to <em>everything</em> we can represent in terms of chains of causes and effects. We can proceed from start to end without any need for a novel thought.</p>
<p>But frequently, to construct such a path, we have to ignore important interactions and dependencies that run in other directions.</p>
<p>In loopy situations, one may find success in shifting from &ldquo;causal&rdquo; learning to &ldquo;clausal&rdquo; learning. If data values are annotated with dependencies, e.g. labeled with external provenance, with justifications for data-processing decisions, etc., then dependency-directed backtracking may help to path-find by avoiding sets of premises that support previously discovered contradictions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In this way, annotating data with provenance metadata can formally help to &ldquo;straighten things out&rdquo;.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#principled">principled</a> system has predictable relationships between its modules, whereas an <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#adaptable">adaptable</a> system has sparse and flexible relationships between its modules.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#selfconscious">selfconscious</a> culture, design and construction is a specialized task, taught in schools using abstract principles, whereas in an <a href="https://donnywinston.com/elements_of_clojure/#unselfconscious">unselfconscious</a> culture, design and construction is taught using direct demonstration and reflects the constraints and variation of an environment.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The structures of a selfconscious culture are principled; they are not meant to change. If the environment changes, the structure is hardened against the change rather than adapting to it. Some principled structures, like skyscrapers or stadiums, can hold thousands of people.</p>
<p>The structures of an unselfconscious culture are adaptable; they reflect the present needs of the inhabitants. Examples include igloos &ndash; there is no &ldquo;architect&rdquo; &ndash; each person builds their own home. If an igloo grows too warm, someone can poke a hole in the wall. When it grows too cold, the hole can be filled in. Such structures tend to be only large enough to hold a single family.</p>
<p>How can we be principled, having long-range plans, and also be adaptable? How can we balance what we want to be versus what we want now?</p>
<p>An interface pulled in many directions is intrinsically stable, but an interface pulled in a single direction tends to shift &ndash; the interface itself will become vestigial. For example, the mitochondrion is now just another interdependent part of a principled whole &ndash; it is no longer an independent organism.</p>
<p>It is the ecosystem, not the organism, that adapts to change. An organism may disappear, its niche filled by something else. Roles are fungible because organisms consume and emit the same resources; they share a common interface.</p>
<p>Consider Overton windows: lawmakers often position proposed legislation (principled components) wrt an observed ecosystem of discourse (currently-stable interface).</p>
<p>We cannot have a system that is wholly principled. We can have a collection of principled components, built to be discarded, slotted into / separated by interfaces that can last only given a rich ecosystem of alternatives.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>There are two fundamental approaches to indirect control in code.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In an <em>open</em> approach, we can change the behavior of dereferencing code by conveying different values. The decision-making mechanism must be unordered. Typically, this is implemented in code using a data structure with a distinct set of keys, i.e. a <em>lookup table</em>.</p>
<p>In a <em>closed</em> approach, we can only change the decision-making process by changing the underlying code. A conditional, e.g. an expression that uses an <code>if/elif/else</code> or <code>match/case</code> form in Python, is closed. It is ordered, and if predicates aren&rsquo;t disjoint, order matters.</p>
<p>While an open table <em>conveys</em> values, a conditional <em>decides</em> based on values. For a table to be useful, it must avoid conflicts. Conditionals avoid conflicts by making explicit, fixed decisions. An open approach must avoid conflicts in a dynamic way.</p>
<p>Consider all the kinds of tricks we use to try to force ourselves to work when we&rsquo;re tired or distracted:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Willpower</em>: Tell yourself, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give in to that,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Keep on trying.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Activity</em>: Move around. Exercise. Inhale. Shout.</li>

<![CDATA[<p>If self-control were easy, we might end up accomplishing nothing at all. Extinction would be swift indeed for species that could simply switch off hunger or pain. Instead, there must be checks and balances.</p>
<p>Imagine if any one process could seize and hold control over all the rest &ndash; we wouldn&rsquo;t complete many tasks. So, for processes to exploit each other&rsquo;s skills, roundabout pathways have to be discovered.</p>
<p>Fantasies can provide missing paths. You may not be able to make yourself angry simply by deciding to be angry, but you can still imagine objects or situations that <em>make</em> you angry, that, in effect, <em>arouse</em> your <em>Anger</em> and, for example, its tendency to counter <em>Sleep</em> as a self-control &ldquo;trick&rdquo; to continue <em>Work</em>.</p>
<p>For conscious schemes for self-control to work, e.g. in which we offer rewards to ourselves, incentives need to be discovered &ndash; our processes&rsquo; dispositions must be learned. This may involve bargaining and deception. But self-incentive tricks often don&rsquo;t work because, again, directness is dangerous.</p>
<p>Indirection is a hallowed design technique in computer programming. Code and processes can be made more robust through separation between <em>what</em> and <em>how</em>, when &ldquo;how does this work?&rdquo; is best answered, &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>To understand what we call the Self, we first must see what Selves are for. <em>One function of the Self is to keep us from changing too rapidly.</em>..If we changed our minds too recklessly, we could never know what we might want next. We&rsquo;d never get much done because we could never depend on ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider Hickey&rsquo;s <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-materials-paradigm-and-epochal-time/">epochal time model</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/epochal-time-model-JOZA7dl2S8.png" alt="epochal-time-model"></p>
<p>What is the function here of Identity (i.e., the Self)? What makes a succession of states more than just a sequence of values?</p>
<p>Consider <em>identity</em> = <em>id</em> + <em>entity</em>. That is, an identity is a unique instance (with a primary key <em>id</em>) of an <em>entity</em> of a certain type.</p>
<p>What makes something an entity of a certain type? It must satisfy an <a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/schema/schema.html#entity-specs">entity spec</a>, i.e. maintain model invariants, including but not limited to the syntactic schema.</p>
<p>Can something have multiple &ldquo;id-entities&rdquo;? Sure. Something can be a Study with ID 123 as well as an Activity with ID 234 if (a) each value over time passes validation as both a Study and an Activity, and (b) each value over time resolves to the same unique individual within each of the Study and Activity model abstractions &ndash; i.e., as a function of the data attributes that these models choose to consider in order to distinguish individuals, each value is a &ldquo;state&rdquo; of &ldquo;the same&rdquo; individual.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-ttl" data-lang="ttl"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># expression of a non-unique name assumption</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To achieve conservation of id-entity, to successfully associate an id-entity &ndash; an identity &ndash; with a sequence of values, to proclaim that sequence to be a succession of states, is to feel confident that certain model invariants are being maintained across the values&rsquo; history, that change is not reckless, that one can depend on something.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The art of a great painting is not in any one idea, nor in a multitude of separate tricks for placing all those pigment spots, but in the great network of relationships among its parts.</p>
<p>Similarly, the collection of data and code that comprise a digital resource are by themselves as valueless as aimless, scattered daubs of paint. What counts is what we make of them, in operational and functional phases of processes in systems.</p>
<p>The value of a FAIR resource lies not in some small, precious core, but in its vast, constructed crust.</p>
<p>A fierce belief in conceptual cores &ndash; in spirits, souls, or essences &ndash; may insinuate a helplessness to improve. To seek virtue in such cores may be as wrongly aimed a search as seeking art in canvas cloths by scraping off the painter&rsquo;s work.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Is a self a centralized entity? Is it a society that includes both images of what is (&ldquo;data&rdquo;) and ideals about what ought to be (&ldquo;schema&rdquo;)?</p>
<p>Sometimes we feel decentralized or dispersed, as though we were made of many different parts with different tendencies: <em>&ldquo;One part of me wants this, another part wants that. I must get better control of myself.&rdquo;</em> We sense feelings of disunity, conflicting motives, compulsions, internal tensions, and dissensions. We carry on negotiations in our head.</p>
<p>We also may have a single-view at times: <em>&ldquo;I think, I want, I feel. It&rsquo;s me, myself, who thinks my thoughts. It&rsquo;s not some nameless crowd or cloud of selfless parts.&rdquo;</em> And the times we feel most reasonably unified can be just the times that others see us as the most confused.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-materials-paradigm-and-epochal-time/">an epochal time model</a>, a &ldquo;self&rdquo; - an identity &ndash; is a succession of images &ndash; of states; observers/processors may interpret the state-image data via a succession of contexts — of ideals / schema-versions.</p>
<p>Recent renewed interest in domain-team-driven distributed data-product governance, i.e. “data mesh”, may too be an expression of one-self-or-many tension.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>One must not mistake defining things for knowing what they are. You can know what a tiger is without defining it. You may define a tiger, yet know scarcely anything about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Self&rdquo; is a term used to talk about a sense of identity. Instead of asking, <em>&ldquo;What are selves?&rdquo;</em> we can ask, instead, <em>&ldquo;What are our ideas about Selves?&rdquo;</em> &ndash; and then we can ask, <em>&ldquo;What psychological functions do those ideas serve?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Our ideas about our Selves include beliefs about what we <em>are</em> &ndash; both what we are capable of doing and what we may be disposed to do. We may refer to such beliefs as <em>self-images</em>, as opposed to <em>self-ideals</em>, that is, ideas about what we&rsquo;d <em>like</em> to be or about what we <em>ought</em> to be.</p>
<p>When dealing with digital resources &ndash; datasets, models, workflows, schema &ndash; there are subtle semiotics at play in representing and communicating these selves and their identities:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/semiotic-information-triad-ZiIhqWAvNf.png" alt="semiotic-information-triad"></p>
<p>There are real things that occupy a given domain and scope of inquiry that are, unfortunately, neither understandable nor transmittable as fully correct messages (in the Shannon information sense).</p>
<p>Consider a dynamic digital object that represents the total information theoretic potential of &ndash; that is, all that one might say about &ndash; a real object. In representing our dynamic objects, we can only convey them as somewhat incomplete immediate objects &ndash; there is information loss.</p>
<p>So too is there loss in how these immediate objects are pointed to or signified &ndash; as something iconic like an image, described in words, etc. Our signification, our message, is imperfect.</p>
<p>And there is information loss at the response level by the interpreter that must decode the message that had to be encoded.</p>
<p>Finally, this may be the case not just for real things, but for ideal things - not just what is, but what ought to be.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Pain can simplify point of view. When you&rsquo;re in pain, it&rsquo;s hard to think of anything else.</p>
<p>Pleasure too can simplify point of view. You may feel that nothing is more important than finding a way to make that pleasure last.</p>
<p>We think of pain and pleasure as opposites - pleasure makes us draw its object near, whereas pain impels us to reject its object. They are also similar &ndash; they both distract, making rival goals seem small.</p>
<p>Fear and courage each do best by knowing both. Whether on offense or defense, you seek to guess the opponent&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/extreme-extreme-ooIwls4njK.png" alt="extreme-extreme"></p>
<p>Sometimes, one of two seeming opposites is nothing but the absence of the other: sound and silence, light and darkness, interest and unconcern.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/presence-absence-Y3g46nqHFX.png" alt="presence-absence"></p>
<p>In appearing opposed, two things may serve related goals, or may engage selfsame agencies.</p>
<p>In contexts of data and code, opposition may signal an opportunity for structural sharing, for reuse.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s say that the urges of the <em>Play</em> process compete with those of other processes, like <em>Sleep</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="destructiveness-play-in-control"
width="80%"
src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/destructiveness-play-in-control-hZHo3acyNz.png" /></p>
<p>If <em>Sleep</em> wrests control, then perhaps a <em>Wrecker</em>-process urge, previously constrained and now freed from <em>Play</em>&rsquo;s constraint, need only persist for one more kick to gain the satisfaction of a final crash:</p>
<p><img alt="destructiveness-sleep-in-control"
width="80%"
src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/destructiveness-sleep-in-control-U17MXuQdMQ.png"/></p>
<p>This destructiveness may seem senseless, but it may serve to communicate frustration at the loss of a goal, and to serve constructive goals by leaving fewer problems to be solved &ndash; the kick may leave a mess &ldquo;outside&rdquo;, yet it may tidy the process orchestration.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t true that when <em>Sleep</em> starts, <em>Play</em> must quit and all its agents have to cease. A mind can &ldquo;go to bed, yet still build towers in its head.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Designing any society, be it human or computational, involves decisions like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which agents choose which others to do what jobs?</li>
<li>Who will decide which jobs are done at all?</li>
<li>Who decides what efforts to expend?</li>
<li>How will conflicts be settled?</li>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>The longer an internal conflict persists among an agent&rsquo;s subordinates, the weaker becomes that agent&rsquo;s status among its own competitors. If such internal problems aren&rsquo;t settled soon, other agents will take control and the agents formerly involved will be &ldquo;dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever several agents have to compete for the same resources, they are likely to get into conflicts.</p>
<p>Those agents&rsquo; superiors, too, may be under competitive pressure and likely to grow weak themselves whenever their subordinates are slow in achieving their goals, no matter whether because of conflicts between them or because of individual incompetence.</p>
<p>However, an agency that has &ldquo;lost control&rdquo; can continue to work inside itself &ndash; and thus become prepared to seize a later opportunity.</p>
<p>Must every &ldquo;mind&rdquo; contain some topmost center of control? Not necessarily. We sometimes settle conflicts by appealing to superiors, but other conflicts never end and never cease to trouble us.</p>
<p>Good human supervisors plan ahead to avoid conflicts in the first place, and &ndash; when they can&rsquo;t &ndash; they try to settle quarrels locally before appealing to superiors. But tiny mental/computational agents simply cannot know enough to be able to negotiate with one another or to find effective ways to adjust to each other&rsquo;s interference. Only larger agencies could be resourceful enough to do such things, to become versatile enough to negotiate by offering support for its subordinates&rsquo; goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Please, <em>Wrecker</em>, wait a moment more till <em>Builder</em> adds just one more block: it&rsquo;s worth it for a louder crash!&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Many children not only like to build, they also like to knock things down &ndash; to hear the complicated noises and watch so many things move at once.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a sibling agent to <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-world-of-blocks/"><em>Builder</em></a> called <em>Wrecker</em>, whose specialty is knocking things down:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/wrecker-cRAwagc53l.png" alt="wrecker"></p>
<p>Suppose <em>Wrecker</em> gets aroused, but there&rsquo;s nothing in sight to smash. Then <em>Wrecker</em> will have to get some help &ndash; by putting <em>Builder</em> to work, for example.</p>
<p>But what if, at some later time, <em>Wrecker</em> considers the tower to be high enough to smash, while <em>Builder</em> wants to make it taller still? Who could settle that dispute?</p>
<p>Is the decision left to <em>Wrecker</em>, who activated <em>Builder</em> in the first place? What if both were activated by a higher-level agent, <em>Play-with-Blocks</em>? What if that agent in turn was activated by a <em>Play</em> agent, who may be in conflict with <em>Eat</em> and <em>Sleep</em>?</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/conflict-builder-wrecker-OciBzr2npH.png" alt="conflict-builder-wrecker"></p>
<p>A child&rsquo;s play is not an isolated thing. It always happens in the context of other real-life concerns. Whatever we may chose to do, there are always other things we&rsquo;d also like to do.</p>
<p>In single-thread, synchronous computer programming, prolonged conflict may be avoided. A function A may call another function B in its body and wait for B to return. If B encounters trouble, it can raise an exception for A to catch. The chain of command for conflict resolution can be clear.</p>
<p>In the case of asynchronous, independent agents like <em>Builder</em> and <em>Wrecker</em>, what is the effect of prolonged conflict? Perhaps the conflict tends to weaken their mutual superior, <em>Play-with-Blocks</em>. In turn, this could reduce <em>Play-with-Blocks</em>&rsquo;s ability to suppress <em>its</em> rivals. Next, if that conflict isn&rsquo;t settled soon, it could weaken <em>Play</em> at the next-highest level. Then, <em>Eat</em> or <em>Sleep</em> might seize control.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Are people machines?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone knows that machines can behave only in lifeless, mechanical ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This objection seems reasonable. A person ought to feel offended at being likened to any <em>trivial</em> machine. But it seems to me that the word &ldquo;machine&rdquo; is getting to be out of date.</p>
<p>We ought to recognize that we&rsquo;re still in an early era of machines, with virtually no idea of what they may become. What if some visitor from outer space had come a billion years ago to judge the fate of earthly life from watching clumps of cells that hadn&rsquo;t even learned to crawl?</p>
<p>Our first intuitions about computers came from experiences with machines of the 1940s, which contained only thousands of parts. But a human brain contains billions of cells, each one complicated by itself and connected to many thousands of others.</p>
<p>Present-day computers represent an intermediate degree of complexity. And yet, we continue to use old words as though there had been no change at all. We need to adapt our attitudes to phenomena that work on scales never before conceived. Does the term &ldquo;machine&rdquo; take us far enough?</p>
<p>Rhetoric won&rsquo;t settle anything. In trying to understand what the vast mechanisms of the human brain may do, we can find self-respect in knowing what wonderful machines we are  (and what a FAIR, internetworked &ldquo;electronic brain&rdquo; could be).</p>

<![CDATA[<p>GUIs and APIs are both human interfaces. They both frame perspectives on data/operation service
offerings so that human beings can navigate and consume them. The human being in the case of APIs is
the application programmer, a subset of users. GUIs are applications, so it is natural to expect an
API’s capabilities to be a superset of a corresponding GUI’s — application programmers program the
GUI using the API.</p>
<p>Your resource service interface is not necessarily understandable &ndash; discoverable, crawl-able &ndash;  by
machines. APIs are generally not machine-actionable interfaces.</p>
<p>Nor is it necessarily wise that a given API be made machine-actionable. This would result in a
two-audience problem. With two different target audiences, humans and machines, how could an API
serve both well?</p>
<p>I used to think that GUIs were for humans and APIs were for machines. I now have a SICP-esque
perspective on APIs: they &ldquo;must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to
execute.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<![CDATA[<p>In general, we&rsquo;re least aware of what our minds do best. It&rsquo;s mainly when systems start to fail that we engage the special agencies involved with what we call &ldquo;consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, we&rsquo;re more aware of simple processes that don&rsquo;t work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly.</p>
<p>This phenomenon helps to explain the poor performance of many so-called <em>expert systems</em> in the 1980s. There were attempts to fully rationalize human expertise as calculative rules. The effect was often to regress an expert&rsquo;s <em>knowing how</em> to a novice practitioner&rsquo;s <em>knowing that</em>.</p>
<p>Skill acquisition in unstructured domains moves not towards abstract rules, but rather from abstract rules to particular cases. And &ldquo;the distinction between education, a process aimed at drawing out the abilities of the student, and training, in which the student is learning to negotiate a structured domain, is crucial.”</p>
<p>This may help shed light on much of the recent mixed success of &ldquo;unexplainable&rdquo; neural-network-based decision systems.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>What keeps a mouse contained in a box?</p>
<p>It is the way a box prevents motion in all directions. Each board bars escape in a certain direction. The left side keeps the mouse from going left, the right from going right, the top keeps it from leaping out, and so on.</p>
<p>The secret of a box is simply in how the boards are arranged to prevent motion in <em>all</em> directions. That&rsquo;s what <em>containing</em> means.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s silly to expect any separate board by itself to contain any <em>containment</em>, even though each contributes to the containing. It is like the cards of a straight flush in poker; only the full hand has any value at all.</p>
<p>The same applies to words like <em>life</em> and <em>mind</em>. It is foolish to use these words for describing the smallest components of living things because these words were invented to describe how larger assemblies interact. Like <em>boxing-in</em>, words like <em>living</em> and <em>thinking</em> are useful for describing phenomena that result from certain combinations of relationships.</p>

<p>However, just like <em>life</em> has gradually lost much of its mystery &ndash; at least for modern biologists, because they understand so many of the important interactions among the chemicals in cells &ndash; FAIR can be demystified by understanding how the components of a well-made FAIR resource interact to facilitate reuse and repurposing.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re often told that certain wholes are &ldquo;more than the sum of their parts.&rdquo; We hear this expressed with reverent words like &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; and &ldquo;gestalt,&rdquo; whose academic tones suggest that they refer to clear and definite ideas. But I suspect the actual function of such terms is to anesthetize a sense of ignorance. We say &ldquo;gestalt&rdquo; when things combine to act in ways we can&rsquo;t explain, &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; when we&rsquo;re caught off guard by unexpected happenings and realize we understand less than we thought we did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes a tower more than separate blocks, or a wall more than a set of many bricks? Every block/brick is held in place by its neighbors and gravity. Why is a chain more than its various links? To explain why chain-links cannot come apart, we can demonstrate how each would get in its neighbors&rsquo; way.</p>
<p>In graphical diagrams of such physical situations, the edges drawn between nodes are &ndash; implicitly or explicitly &ndash; labeled, qualified relations. An arrow is not a mystery &ndash; it is, for example, gravitational force.</p>
<p>Sometimes, giving names to things can help by leading us to focus on some mystery. It&rsquo;s harmful, though, when naming leads the mind to think that names alone bring meaning close.</p>
<p>With Linked Data, all edges relating parts are labeled, and those labels are things, not strings. Such discipline can help us to not fool ourselves.</p>

<p>Some are adamant about reducing to what has come before. This has worked remarkably well for the core of physics.</p>
<p>These inclinations are not incompatible given some kind of &ldquo;leveling&rdquo;, with discipline about connections. Standing on the shoulders of giants and all that.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>An agent like <em>Builder</em> is not merely a collection of parts like <em>Find</em>, <em>Get</em>, <em>Put</em>, and all the rest. <em>Builder</em> would not work at all unless those agents were linked to one another by a suitable network of interconnections:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/agents-by-themselves-and-in-bureaucracy-WDrJoLTNjp.png" alt="agents-by-themselves-and-in-bureaucracy"></p>
<p>Could you predict what <em>Builder</em> does from knowing just that left-hand list above? Of course not. First, we must know how each separate part works. Second, we must know how each part interacts with those to which it is connected. And third, we have to understand how all these local interactions combine to accomplish what that system <em>does</em> &ndash; as seen from the outside.</p>
<p>There is lots of prior art for understanding combinations of component interactions, whether as expression trees or wiring diagrams. Computer programming has traditionally emphasized the former, but note how <em>Move</em> has two &ldquo;parents&rdquo; in the diagram above.</p>
<p>I leave you with the intro to the last chapter of <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decades of programming experience have taken a toll on our collective imagination. We come from a culture of scarcity, where computation and memory were expensive, and concurrency was difficult to arrange and control. This is no longer true. But our languages, our algorithms, and our architectural ideas are based on those assumptions. Our languages are basically sequential and directional &ndash; even functional languages assume that computation is organized around values percolating up through expression trees. Multidirectional constraints are hard to express in functional languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="escaping-the-von-neumann-straitjacket">Escaping the Von Neumann straitjacket</h3>
<p>The propagator model of computation provides one avenue of escape. The propagator model is built on the idea that the basic computational elements are propagators, autonomous independent machines interconnected by shared cells through which they communicate. Each propagator machine continuously examines the cells it is connected to, and adds information to some cells based on computations it can make from information it can get from others. Cells accumulate information and propagators produce information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the propagator infrastructure is based on propagation of data through interconnected independent machines, propagator structures are better expressed as wiring diagrams than as expression trees. In such a system partial results are useful, even though they are not complete. For example, the usual way to compute a square root is by successive refinement using Heron&rsquo;s method. In traditional programming, the result of a square root computation is not available to subsequent computations until the required error tolerance is achieved. By contrast, in an analog electrical circuit that performed the same function, the partial results could be used by the next stages as first approximations to their computations. This is not an analog/digital problem—it is organizational. In a propagator mechanism the partial results of a digital process can be made available without waiting for the final result.</p>

<p><em>Builder</em> seems to lead a double life. As agency, it seems to know its job. As agent, it cannot know anything at all.</p>
<p>And knowing how is not the same as knowing that. If while performing an activity expertly you find yourself consciously reflecting on what you are doing and the rules for doing it, chances are you will experience a severe degradation of performance &ndash; you fall victim to &ldquo;knowing that&rdquo; as it interrupts and replaces your &ldquo;knowing how&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hermans <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> highlights three kinds of confusion when reading code: lack of knowledge, lack of information, and lack of processing power. These also reflect a gradual descent from know-how focus to know-that focus, from seeing agencies to tracing the wiring-together and actions of individual agents.</p>
<p>So it may be with a society of FAIR digital resources &ndash; agents may be distributed, and yet agency may be coherent.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-world-of-blocks/">found a way</a> to make a tower builder out of parts. But <em>Builder</em> is really far from done.</p>
<p>For example, how could <em>Find</em> determine which blocks are still available for use? It would have to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; the scene in terms of what it is trying to do.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll need theories both about what it means to understand and about how a machine could have a goal.</p>
<p>Consider all the <em>practical</em> judgments that an actual <em>Builder</em> would have to make. It would have to decide whether there are enough blocks to accomplish its goal and whether they are strong and wide enough to support the others that will be placed on them.</p>
<p>By the time we are adults, we regard all of this to be simple &ldquo;common sense&rdquo;. But that deceptive pair of words conceals almost countless different skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Common sense is not a simple thing. Instead, it is an immense society of hard-earned practical ideas &ndash; of multitudes of life-learned rules and exceptions, dispositions and tendencies, balances and checks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dreyfus calls the ability to intuitively respond to patterns without decomposing them into component features &ldquo;holistic discrimination and association&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When things are proceeding normally, experts don&rsquo;t solve problems and don&rsquo;t make decisions; they do what normally works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As each new group of skills matures, we build more layers on top of them. As time goes on, the layers below become increasingly remote until, when we try to speak of them in later life, we find ourselves with little more to say than <em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</em></p>

<![CDATA[<p>Imagine a child playing with blocks. Imagine the child&rsquo;s mind contains a host of smaller minds - &ldquo;agents&rdquo;. Imagine an agent called <em>Builder</em> in control. <em>Builder</em> makes towers from blocks:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/block-tower-build-UOFur3qMlp.png" alt="block-tower-build"></p>
<p><em>Builder</em> is a simple agent. It needs help from several other agents to choose a place to start the tower, add a new block to the tower, and decide when it is high enough:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/builder-agent-tree-89Ps39fndw.png" alt="builder-agent-tree"></p>
<p>But doesn&rsquo;t <em>Add</em> have a big job as well, too big for a single, simple agent? First <em>Add</em> must <em>Find</em> a new block, then the hand must <em>Get</em> that block and <em>Put</em> it on the tower top:</p>
<p><img src="https://files.polyneme.xyz/dropshare/add-agent-tree-HUKT9cXMiv.png" alt="add-agent-tree"></p>
<p>Why break things into such small parts? Because minds, like towers, are made that way &ndash; except they&rsquo;re composed of processes instead of blocks. Scientific workflows are also made that way.</p>
<p>Does making stacks of blocks seem insignificant? You probably didn&rsquo;t always feel that way. You may have spent joyful weeks in early childhood on building stacks of blocks. As grown-ups, we all know how to do such things, but how did we learn to do them?</p>
<p>This forgetfulness, this amnesia of infancy, applies to expert scientific practice as well. All our wonderful methods weren&rsquo;t always inside our minds &ndash; they began and grew, like we begin and grow computer-simulation programs and data analysis pipelines.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>For a method, a protocol, thought about and done by you, what&rsquo;s a &ldquo;you&rdquo;? What kinds of smaller
entities may cooperate to carry out a procedure? Try this: <em>pick up a cup of tea</em>. Imagine that</p>
<ul>
<li>your <em>GRASPING</em> agents want to keep hold of the cup,</li>
<li>your <em>BALANCING</em> agents want to keep the tea from spilling out,</li>
<li>your <em>THIRST</em> agents want you to drink the tea, and</li>
<li>your <em>MOVING</em> agents want to get the cup to your lips.</li>
</ul>
<p>If each does it&rsquo;s own job, the really big job will get done by all of them together: drinking tea.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always doing several things at once, like planning and walking and talking. These processes
involve more machinery than anyone can understand at once.</p>
<p>In the next few notes, we&rsquo;ll focus on one ordinary activity - making things with children&rsquo;s building
blocks. In doing this, we&rsquo;ll try to imitate how Galileo and Newton learned so much by studying the
simplest kinds of pendulums and weights, mirrors and prisms.</p>
<p>By focusing a microscope on simple objects, we hope to open up a great and unexpected universe, the
same reason why so many biologists nowadays devote more attention to tiny germs and viruses than to
magnificent lions and tigers. The work of artificial-intelligence researchers with children&rsquo;s blocks
can be the prism and the pendulum for studying scientific procedure.</p>

<p>In science, one can learn the most by studying what seems the least.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>How could solid-seeming computer hardware support such a ghostly thing as research progress? The
world of scientific inquiry and the world of bits appear too far apart to interact in any way.</p>
<p>A few centuries ago it seemed impossible to explain Life - living things appeared to be so different
from anything else. Last century, von Neumann helped show how cell-machines could reproduce. Watson
and Crick helped show how cells make copies of their hereditary code.</p>
<p>How does scientific process work? Gödel and Turing helped reveal the range of what machines could be
made to do. McCulloch and Pitts in the 1940s began to show how machines might be made to see,
reason, and remember.</p>
<p>We are still far from being able to create machines that do all of the scientific work that people
do. But we also need better theories about how knowledge is acquired and applied, how data is
interpreted, etc. Tiny machines, &ldquo;agents&rdquo;, could be &ldquo;particles&rdquo; helpful in constructing such
theories and operationalizing them.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>To explain a FAIR research platform, we have to show how they are built from mindless stuff, smaller
and simpler than anything we&rsquo;d consider smart. What could these simpler particles be &ndash; the &ldquo;agents&rdquo;
that compose the platform? There are many questions to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function: How do agents work?</li>
<li>Embodiment: What are they made of?</li>
<li>Interaction: How do they communicate?</li>
<li>Learning: How do we make new agents and change old ones?</li>
<li>Character: What are the most important kinds of agents?</li>
<li>Authority: What happens when agents disagree?</li>
<li>Intention: How could such networks want or wish?</li>
<li>Competence: How can groups of agents do what separate agents cannot do?</li>
<li>Selfness: What gives them unity or personality?</li>
<li>Meaning: How could they understand anything?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions all seem difficult when we sever each one&rsquo;s connections to the other ones. But once
we see a platform as a society of agents, each answer can illuminate the rest.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Self-describing&rdquo; data products include/contain/link to any &ldquo;knowledge products&rdquo;

<em>information products</em>?</p>
<p>Perhaps self-describing <em>information products</em> include/contain/link to any &ldquo;wisdom products&rdquo; (usage

<p>I started thinking about all this after listening to the conversation with Shane Gibson on <a href="https://anchor.fm/datadotworld/episodes/Agile-like-a-fox--but-for-data--WShane-Gibson-from-AgileData-io-e1fqtu2">a recent

inform corresponding DIKW &ldquo;products&rdquo; as part of a process of ongoing improvement of operationalizing

<![CDATA[<p>How do FAIR data resources work? How can you build a FAIR resource from many little parts, each
non-FAIR by itself?</p>
<p>Minsky&rsquo;s <em>The Society of Mind</em> tries to explain how minds can work, how intelligence can emerge from
non-intelligence, how you can build a mind from many little mindless parts.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;society of mind&rdquo; scheme, a mind is made of many smaller <em>agents</em>. Each agent plays a simple
role that needs no mind at all. When we join enough of them, we get &ldquo;mind&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a FAIR &ldquo;mind&rdquo; (e.g. a research knowledge management system), each connected resource -
plans/protocols, recorded observations, information products (tables/figures/plots), assigned
metadata/tags, validation/review artifacts, integration/analysis code, publication/distribution
assets, data schemas / controlled vocabularies, archives &ndash; may also play a simple role that needs
no &ldquo;FAIRification&rdquo; at all. When we join enough of them in principled ways, we get &ldquo;FAIR&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s much the same for shattered pots as for the cogs of great machines. Until you&rsquo;ve seen some of
the rest, you can&rsquo;t make sense of any part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each part may have lots of cross-connections. It&rsquo;s not clear that the parts may be arranged so that
we can climb &ldquo;straight to the top&rdquo; together, by mental stair-steps, one by one. The parts are
tangled in a Web. Let&rsquo;s begin.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Not documenting failures causes them to be repeated. This repetition is waste because no new
information is generated. Only <em>new</em> failures generate information.</p>

for a test with two outcomes, seek a 50% failure rate. This is information-theoretic support for the
binary search algorithm and for determining LD50 in pharmaceutical toxicity trials.</p>
<p>Not all evaluation is designed to maximize information gain. Validation tests strive for 100%

<![CDATA[<p>URIs are great for namespacing terms. However, the local names — after the last <code>/</code> — could be a
free-for-all. One common convention — but not typically a <em>contract</em> — is to use upper camel case
for <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Class">rdfs:Class</a> instances and lower camel case for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Property">rdf:Property</a> instances. Is it useful to
systematize the construction of local names? <a href="https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/column-name-contracts/">Emily Riederer argues
yes</a>.</p>
<p>I like her general approach, and I think her eight &ldquo;level 1&rdquo; measure types are nice examples that
could be accepted without discussion by many teams. I often start &ldquo;count of quanity or event
occurrence&rdquo; terms with <code>n_</code> and &ldquo;unique identifer for an entity&rdquo; terms with <code>id_</code> in my code.</p>
<p>A pleasant surprise was seeing a concept map at the end of the post, a boxes-and-arrows diagram to
help illustrate the concepts from the post, which I have reproduced here:</p>
<figure> <img src="/img/column-name-contracts.png" width="100%" alt="concept map for column name
contracts" title="concept map for column name contracts"/>
<figcaption>Concept map for column name contracts.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I would like to more formally represent the knowledge expressed in my writing. Step one seems to be
to draw out a concept map. After this, I can translate such a diagram to RDF. In this way, I might
build up a queryable knowledge base. Perhaps more importantly, I will encounter and hopefully
overcome many obstacles to doing this effectively, including weaknesses in tooling.</p>
<p>To start, here is a tiny RDF dataset of the above concept map, serialized as turtle:</p>

<![CDATA[<p>What is the &ldquo;killer use case&rdquo; for Reasoning, i.e., inferencing over a semantic graph database?</p>
<p>Data in a relational database &ldquo;knows nothing.&rdquo; Data in a graph database &ldquo;knows how it is connected&rdquo;
&ndash; you can ask an entity to tell you who its neighbors are 3 hops out, or if two pieces are
connected up to 20 hops. Data with Reasoning &ldquo;knows how to think.&rdquo; But what does that mean exactly?
What do you get? What is the thing that you win by having reasoning?</p>
<p>Reasoning lets you see what isn’t there (yet). In a graph database without reasoning, if I am
connected to someone as my father, and someone else is connected to my father as his sister, but I
am not explicitly connected to her with a materialized edge in the graph as my aunt, I cannot ask
directly for my aunt and get a solution - I need to ask for my dad’s sister. With reasoning, I can
ask for my aunt and not care if there is a &ldquo;real&rdquo; edge to hop along.</p>
<p>Reasoning is a strategy to address a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; you may encounter in database usage, i.e. not
every fact you expect to be materialized has in fact been materialized. Reasoning is helpful
particularly when you don’t have the computational and storage resources to completely clear the
fog, i.e. materialize all possible inferences.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I recently came across a procedure for achieving a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow
state</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>One activity at a time.</li>
<li>The activity is meaningful to you.</li>
<li>You work at the edge of your abilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recall the source of this. So, dear reader, please send me something I can cite if you have
encountered this 3-step procedure elsewhere.</p>
<p>In this post, I relate the above procedure to my recent post on
<a href="/posts/mean-ing">mean-ing</a>.</p>
<aside> Before I proceed: I&rsquo;ve noticed myself starting to post notes that are more raw
and/or <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woo-woo">woo-woo</a> than perhaps typical. I&rsquo;d like
to give myself permission to do this without placing undue burden on readers more interested in my
&ldquo;regularly scheduled programming&rdquo;, that is, in notes on machine-centric science that are less raw
and/or less woo-woo. So, I have added the <a href="/tags/raw">#raw</a> and <a href="/tags/woo-woo">#woo-woo</a> tags to
this post, and I&rsquo;ll include them in future posts as appropriate. </aside>
<p>Embracing step 1, step 2 follows - you can only do one thing at a time, so naturally you want to
avoid the unmeaningful.</p>
<p>On step 2: what does &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo;&hellip;mean? The activity is rich with <a href="/posts/mean-ing">mean-ing</a>,
that is, you can see a central tendency for the thing, but there is observable variation, so
frequent mean-ing is necessary. It is rewarding and satisfying to identify the possibility of and
the emerging value of a central tendency as you gather and characterize observations.</p>
<p>On step 3: gather observations that you don’t anticipate will be <em>too</em> different (&ldquo;mean-ing&rdquo;-wise),
so that while you may perturb the central tendency, it likely won’t change drastically after any
given iteration of the activity. If it does change drastically, you likely will experience worry and
anxiety. You will lose confidence in the mean-ing you’re doing / building up &ndash; you will ask
yourself, &ldquo;Is there actually a central tendency at all here?&rdquo; Bottom line: you will want to take a
step back; you will exit flow.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A traditional postdoc filler seeks to transition to a different role, that of professor or staff.
What if someone were to <em>specialize</em> in this kind of role, e.g. for a certain kind of project in a
certain kind (e.g. group size) of research environment?</p>
<p>Such a position would be akin to the modern \(\approx\) 1-3 yr startup position specialized to a
certain growth stage of a startup. In Silicon Valley, for instance, it’s not uncommon for someone to
specialize in a certain role for a certain class of company and to change jobs once the company
essentially becomes a different (class of) company.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>There are numerous factors, such as the lack of geographic concentration of relevant positions &ndash;
someone with such a specialization may thrive in the Boston area but not elsewhere, similar to how
the startup-role someone may not thrive outside Silicon Valley, although remote-friendly roles could
mitigate this &ndash; and massive gaps in typical compensation levels, that pummel the analogy here. And
there are policy factors, such as many institutions limiting postdoctoral applicants to those who
have received their PhD no more than N years ago, that structurally inhibit such a generalization of
the postdoc role.</p>
<p>Imagine, though, a generalization of the postdoc role to that of an &ldquo;employed consultant&rdquo; who may
expect to transition from client to client, i.e. employer to employer, while increasing their
specialized expertise (and compensation) over the course of their career.</p>
<p>Thus, someone not interested in running a business on top of building and exercising their hands-on
expertise &ndash; marketing, sales, managing client relationships, invoicing, etc. &ndash; can nonetheless
thrive without needing to transition to a management/supervisory role, e.g. that of a professor or
group lead that is responsible for hiring, securing funding, etc. in ways that detract from the
personal performance of research activities.</p>

is a window to selected already-available content. The value added to the existing body of content

<p>However, scholarly digital assets &ndash; data, algorithms, tools, workflows, etc. &ndash; that support the
narratives expressed in many publications are often insufficiently

publishing the narrative, whereas digital assets are often de-emphasized as &ldquo;supplementary

<p>For a journal of FAIR overlays, the narrative is supplementary. Source narratives need not be
re-published, that is, the journal is an overlay journal. The value added to the existing body of
content is that of &ldquo;FAIRifying&rdquo; the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid">DIKW</a>).</p>
<p>Rather than resorting to natural language processing (NLP) of published narratives, researchers
could instead reference and repurpose a source publication&rsquo;s core digital assets through one or more
journal-of-FAIR-overlays publications, which are themselves scholarly objects that can be cited.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I was alerted to a great discussion<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> about unifying versus partitioning data models. That
is, you have some data powering some part of your system, and you need to decide how to structure
that data and associate validation logic and behavior &ndash; like calculating properties or triggering
other system actions &ndash; with the bundle of data as it evolves over the course of some ongoing or
completing process.</p>
<p>The concrete example given is an application with a <code>/cakes</code> endpoint. You might <code>POST</code> a JSON
object to it with <code>{name,ingedients,inventor_id}</code> attributes, and get back a JSON object with
<code>{name,ingredients,id,status}</code> attributes. When you create a cake, the cake doesn&rsquo;t have an <code>id</code> in
the system, and it doesn&rsquo;t have a system <code>status</code>, e.g. &ldquo;baking&rdquo;. Also, there may be cake attributes
that aren&rsquo;t assumed to be relevant in a response, e.g. a system ID for the cake&rsquo;s inventor.</p>
<p>Approaches to data modeling here include (1) having e.g. a <code>CreateCakeRequest</code> model for the <code>POST</code>
body and a <code>CreateCakeResponse</code> model for the response, and (2) having one <code>Cake</code> model that gets
passed around and updated. The former approach is one of partitioning and hand-off. The latter is
one of unifying the state space into a single data structure.</p>
<p>There are two other approaches I&rsquo;ve seen and implemented that I guess technically take approach (2),
but also dispatch to approach (1) &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo;. One tries to be principled and explicit about
the under-the-hood partitioning, and the other <del>just kinda wings it</del> emphasizes
flexibility.</p>
<p>The principled, explicit-partitions approach is exemplified by
<a href="/posts/statecharts-as-a-logic-of-effects/">statecharts</a> in that your data model is a unified
&ldquo;machine&rdquo;. Below I show a little Python pseudocode that reflects
<a href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/">XState</a>&rsquo;s JSON representation of a model. There is a privileged data
attribute called <code>state</code> that the machine runtime uses as a switch in order to respond to incoming
events/requests of the model. In this way, the &ldquo;one&rdquo; model dispatches to finitely many little
models, all of which have access to the <code>context</code> structure.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A similar explicit-partitions approach is customary for Elm applications, where a unified model is
fed along with a message, i.e. an event/request, to a unified update function that again uses case
analysis to switch on the appropriate subspace of logic. In statecharts, the switch is on the state
attribute, whereas for Elm logic, the switch can be two-staged on the message type or model variant,
as both may be custom tagged-union types that are simple to switch on.</p>
<p>A less partition-oriented yet flexible approach is exemplified by the use of models that
cast/conform input data to their own little worlds and yet get persisted to the same underlying
unified data structure. I took this approach recently in implementing a superset of the Global
Alliance for Genomics and Health&rsquo;s (GA4GH) <a href="https://ga4gh.github.io/data-repository-service-schemas/preview/release/drs-1.0.0/docs/">Data Repository Service (DRS)
API</a> in
Python using <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">Pydantic</a> and
<a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>.</p>
<p>In the GA4GH DRS API, a
<a href="https://ga4gh.github.io/data-repository-service-schemas/preview/release/drs-1.0.0/docs/#_drsobject"><code>DrsObject</code></a>
is the central resource. It tells you about some bytes you can access somehow, like via a URL. Since
I added endpoints to create such objects and to tag them with &ldquo;types&rdquo; that are outside the scope of
the current API spec, I needed to have different models that present different interfaces to the
same underlying data, like a bunch of people all having different perspectives when standing around
an elephant. Pydantic helped with this because you can pass in extra fields to a model constructor,
and it simply ignores the extras. And FastAPI helped because you can assign Pydantic models to API
request and response objects per endpoint, which means I can yield the whole enchilada from an
endpoint function and FastAPI will feed it to the registered Pydantic response model to be slimmed
down / conformed for the client as per the OpenAPI contract.</p>
<p>Concretely, I have <code>DrsObjectBase</code>, <code>DrsObjectIn(DrsObjectBase)</code>, and <code>DrsObject(DrsObjectIn)</code>
Pydantic models (<a href="https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-runtime/blob/67c38b6ed1fcaa02417734eafd814d1fc3abc1e5/nmdc_runtime/api/models/object.py">code
here</a>)
that power a family of FastAPI <code>/objects</code> endpoints (<a href="https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-runtime/blob/67c38b6ed1fcaa02417734eafd814d1fc3abc1e5/nmdc_runtime/api/endpoints/objects.py">code
here</a>),
and complementary <code>/object_types</code> models
(<a href="https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-runtime/blob/67c38b6ed1fcaa02417734eafd814d1fc3abc1e5/nmdc_runtime/api/models/object_type.py">code</a>)
and endpoints
(<a href="https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-runtime/blob/67c38b6ed1fcaa02417734eafd814d1fc3abc1e5/nmdc_runtime/api/endpoints/object_types.py">code</a>).
All of the coordinated models (including validation via Pydantic <code>@*validator</code>-decorated methods)
and representational state transfer facilitated by the API are backed by a MongoDB collection that
stores one JSON object per <code>DrsObject</code>, including an embedded array of <code>types</code> that is shielded from
the read-only, spec-adhering DRS API endpoints.</p>
<p>Would I be better off with a partition-oriented data modeling approach for the DRS API
implementation? I&rsquo;m not sure. In any case, it would need to be done &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo;, e.g. with a
<code>_state</code> attribute or similar on the underlying MongoDB document in my case.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>There are user facilities for scientific research. They were born out of the cost of doing “big
science” with hardware that was increasingly resource-intensive, in terms of physical space,
personnel time, and materials. Lawrence’s first cyclotron fit in the palm of his hand. Then he
needed the hills behind Berkeley’s university campus. Today, to do effective and interesting
particle physics research, you need a facility (CERN’s LHC) that spans three national borders.</p>
<p>PIs still allocate portions of grant money to develop and procure small-footprint hardware in their
labs. They still apply for larger grants as co-PIs for larger-footprint hardware. But lots of
specialized hardware is maintained in user facilities. PIs apply to use these facilities and to get
some allocation of its support staff to help operate its inventory of instruments.</p>
<p>Imagine hardware user facilities that don&rsquo;t actually support and maintain the specialized
instruments. Rather, they are more like &ldquo;water and power&rdquo; facilities that provide pipes and hookups
and outlets and floor space where researchers can build, operate, and maintain their domain-specific
instruments. This is typically the case with scientific-computing user facilities, or of scientific
computing services within lab IT departments.</p>
<p>More and more &ldquo;big science&rdquo; is both compute- and data-intensive, being done with &ldquo;big data&rdquo; and what
might be termed &ldquo;big software&rdquo;, domain-specific scientific instruments that are increasingly
resource-intensive to develop, support, and maintain/extend. However, it&rsquo;s hard to contend with the
lack of concrete physicality of software. With software, cathedrals (or bazaars) are built in the
mind.</p>
<p>User facilities are measured not by the publications/research they output directly, but by the
research they enable, by the citations of research products that used facility resources, typically
to synthesize, transform, and characterize physical samples. In typical user facilities, hardware
comes and goes &ndash; the sample is central, portable from instrument to instrument. I believe that
analogous software user facilities must be data-centric: specific software instruments
(applications) come and go, whereas data is the thing that is synthesized, transformed, and
characterized by various domain-specific tools.</p>
<p>What has been your experience with emerging software user facilities or their analogue in your
domain, with resource environments pre-allocated by your organization to reduce the waste of
individual or small groups of PIs spending a portion of study-grant allocations on functionally
equivalent domain-specific software and data systems?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>When writing a multiline data structure literal, the usual convention is to put delimiters like
commas at the end of each line. For example, in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span style="display:flex;"><span>rules <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Don&#39;t panic.&#34;</span>),
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Do NOT panic.&#34;</span>),
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;No shouting.&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When you forget a comma, it&rsquo;s typically a syntax error and not difficult to debug:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span style="display:flex;"><span>rules <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Don&#39;t panic.&#34;</span>),
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Do NOT panic.&#34;</span>)  <span style="color:#75715e"># oops</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;No shouting.&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>(This is why I like that Python allows one to have a trailing comma, which makes it less likely to
encounter this class of error when adding an element to the end of an existing  data structure
literal.)</p>
<p>In languages like Elm, missing commas may be harder to debug:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span style="display:flex;"><span>rules <span style="color:#a6e22e">=</span> [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Don&#39;t panic.&#34;</span>,
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Do NOT panic.&#34;</span>  <span style="color:#75715e">-- hmmm</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  rule <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;No shouting.&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>gets interpreted as</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span style="display:flex;"><span>rules <span style="color:#a6e22e">=</span> [
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   (rule <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Don&#39;t panic.&#34;</span>),
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>   (rule <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Do NOT panic.&#34;</span> rule <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;No shouting.&#34;</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>, that is, as a list of two elements, with the second element being the result of a function call with
three supplied arguments.</p>
<p>Thus, in Elm, there is a convention of commas in front:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elm" data-lang="elm"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">module </span><span style="color:#a6e22e">PhotoGroove</span> exposing (main)

<p>Following the example of Elm style, I&rsquo;m considering the value of a delimiters-in-front style for
hand-authored Turtle (terse triple format for RDF graph data). For example:</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Irving et al.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> approach digital research infrastructure through three related but
distinct concepts: openness, reproducibility, and sustainability.</p>
<p>Openness is about making digital resources generally accessible for
reuse, sharing, and adaptation through an open license.</p>
<p>Reproduciblity is about describing and documenting methods and results
so that anyone with access to the data and methods can re-apply the
methods on the data to obtain the same results.</p>
<p>Sustainability is about making it easy to maintain and extend a system
rather than replace it; this depends not just on the properties of an
artifact, but on the skills of potential maintainers and on the
investments of users.</p>
<p>If you share data and code, but you don’t document how to stage the data
and apply the code, the work is open but not reproducible.</p>
<p>If you document and automate your analysis, but the data is only
accessible to people in your lab, the work is reproducible but not open.</p>
<p>If your work is open and reproducible when initially published, but the
supporting system cannot be adequately maintained and extended, then the
sytem will become abandonware, and the work’s openness and
reproducibility will become less relevant.</p>
<p>To be sustainable, such a system must either be robust to a revolving
door of inexperienced maintainers and scattershot investments of one-off
users, or the field must develop a culture that values tool-building.</p>
<p>How does your team separately address the openness, reproducibility, and
sustainability of its research data product infrastructure?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>What do knowledge governance systems look like in practice?</p>
<p>By knowledge governance, I don&rsquo;t just mean governing ontologies. By knowledge, I mean categories/sets/types of things – what a thing &ldquo;is,&rdquo; or at least what it is described to be in the information system – and the relationships between these types, as opposed to specific recorded facts. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Some practitioners explicitly separate &ldquo;conceptual knowledge&rdquo; (ontologies) from &ldquo;reference knowledge&rdquo; (vocabularies, taxonomies, enumerated lists, etc.), where &ldquo;reference&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect agreement – it could rather reflect chosen policy. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> This is also referred to as a TBox/CBox split <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, where the traditional semantic-practitioner approach of a terminological &ldquo;box&rdquo; (TBox) for ontologies (i.e. defining terms) and assertional box (ABox) for assertions (i.e., recording data) is amended &ndash; a so-called categorical box (CBox) is spun out of the TBox that could be governed seperately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The art of progress is to preserve order amid change and to preserve
change amid order.
<br>– Alfred North Whitehead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may not call what you are doing “governance” because you think that
if you do, you may get approached by some department representative who
tells you, “we can take it from here.” That’s fine.</p>
<p>But how do you manage change with respect to the parts of your
information systems that are not the specific recorded facts – i.e., the
ontologies, schema, controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, enumerated
lists, etc.? I’d love to know.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can
be predicted from initial conditions, and vice versa. There is a similar uncertainty relation
between time and energy: a state that only exists for a short time cannot have a definite energy
because the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang
around for many cycles.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the last chapter of <em>Data and Reality</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, Bill Kent presents an uncertainty relation between
(a) &ldquo;the&rdquo; human way of perceiving information, and (b) the durability of a conceptual data model.
&ldquo;Truth&rdquo; versus utility. Theory versus tool.</p>
<p>He argues that language &ldquo;is merely an incidental means of solving specific problems of communication
or reflection&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we are most prepared to identify as entities or relationships those things for which our
vocabulary happens to contain a word. The presence of such a word focuses our thinking onto what
then appears as a singular phenomenon. The absence of such a word renders the thought diffuse,
non-specific, non-singular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that the use of opaque identifiers can allow one to record statements about concepts
without having to first make a decision about a certain word being singularly acceptable as a
surrogate for a concept. But I digress.</p>
<p>Kent uses the terms &ldquo;scope&rdquo; and &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; for the two observables in his uncertainty relation, and
&ldquo;chance of reconciliation&rdquo; for the limit term. By scope, he means &ldquo;the number of people whose views
have to be reconciled&rdquo;. By reconciliation, he means &ldquo;a state in which the parties involved have
negligible differences in that portion of their world views that is relevant to the purpose at
hand.&rdquo; The chances of achieving a shared view become poorer &ldquo;when we try to encompass broader
purposes, and to involve more people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Technology has fostered interaction among greater numbers of people, and has enabled integration of
processes into monoliths serving wider and wider purposes. It is natural then that &ldquo;discrepancies in
fundamental assumptions will become increasingly exposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duality is this: in an absolute sense, there may be no singular objective reality. However,
groups of people can share a common enough view of it for relatively narrow purposes, so that
reality appears to be objective and stable in most of our working environments.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A lot of extract-transform-load (ETL) work requires unloading and un-transforming first. Rather than
\(ETL\), it&rsquo;s \(L_A^{-1}T_A^{-1}ET_BL_B\). What the data provider did is \(A\). What you want
to do is \(B\).</p>
<p>The data provider gave you a &ldquo;dump&rdquo; of their data. You don&rsquo;t know what it means. If you did, you
could extract (subset) from it according to your needs &ndash; filter entities by some meaningful
criteria and collect selected attributes.</p>
<p>They had data in some intelligible form, extracted what they needed at the time, transformed it for
input to a processing/analysis system, and loaded the transformed extraction into that system. And
now you have an export from that system.</p>
<p>So, you need to reverse their loading and then their transforming (cf. &ldquo;data munging/wrangling&rdquo;) in
order to align it to your conceptual model. Only then can you extract from it, subset it according
to your present needs. Then, you want to process/analyze it efficiently, so you transform it
according to the logical/external model of your processing/analysis system. Finally, you load it
into that system, which stores the data according to some physical/internal (on-disk / in-memory)
model.</p>
<p>You get results. You publish them. You publish the data. How? Do you publish an export of the
physical model? The cycle continues.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s continue to pursue &ldquo;global&rdquo; semantic names, right? This should be fine for scientific
research, where we&rsquo;ve more or less settled on use of the English language, no?</p>
<p>After reading Levary et al. (2012),<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I think that the pursuit of &ldquo;global&rdquo; semantic names for
things is futile, <em>particularly</em> in the context of scientific research.</p>
<p>Words/phrases (aka &ldquo;signs&rdquo;) are often polysemous – they accumulate senses. For example, I inherited
the infuration of my PhD advisor over use of the the term &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; in lithography/metrology to
mean &ldquo;minimum discernable feature dimension&rdquo;, e.g. linewidth, versus what I consider to be the
preferred sense of the term: &ldquo;minimum discernable inter-feature separation&rdquo;, e.g. line spacing.</p>
<p>When encountering terms of art in scientific and technical literature, an author can mean several
things by it, even within a specialized discipline or sub-discipline. In fact, I think that use of
polysemous terminology is to be expected in the research literature, as pursuit of new knowledge is
a primary goal. For new knowledge to be accepted among practitioners, it must be ac<em>knowledge</em>d, and
this may take the form of attempting a change or narrowing of the typical sense of of a term within
the practitioners&rsquo; context. This attempt may be acknowledged by the community, and thus <em>become</em>
(part of the pool of) knowledge it stewards, or it may be rejected.</p>
<p>Senses also accumulate signs. A concept (sense) may be expressed via a set of synonym words/phrases,
aka a <em>synset</em>. Above, I tried to express a concept with the synset &ldquo;{resolution, minimum
discernable inter-feature separation, line spacing, &hellip;}&rdquo;. The longstanding practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_control">authority
control</a> in library science, e.g. authority files
and subject headings, acknowledges this accumulation, but nevertheless often persues a single,
canonical display of each name, a canonical sign for each sense.</p>
<p>My takeaway from Levary et al. (2012)<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is that the appearance of a new concept in a
dictionary often corresponds to the appearance of a word A &ldquo;that was not definable at earlier
times&rdquo;, i.e. a word that required another new word B to define it, which in turn – being a new word
itself – requires another new word C to define it, perhaps simply the former new word A, i.e. C is
A.</p>
<p>In other words, new concepts are loops. It is not reasonable to assume that a concept corresponds to
a single &ldquo;node&rdquo; in a word graph, a synset, and to choose a canonical sign from among candidate
synonyms. Rather, a concept often comprises two or more (but not many more; loops with length &gt; 5
tend to represent semantic misinterpretations) nodes.</p>
<p>This makes it even more difficult to stick a canonical semantic sign on a concept. Thus, I
appreciate the wisdom of opaque identifiers, which can be mapped for particular (json-ld) contexts
to identifiers with human-readable suffixes, with e.g.
<code>owl:equivalentProperty</code>/<code>owl:equivalentClass</code>/<code>owl:sameAs</code> assertions, so that local
human-actionable vocabularies can nonetheless be unambiguously unified.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I recently encountered the Archival Resource Key (<a href="https://arks.org/">ARK</a>) identifier scheme and
read its latest draft specification.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Its thesis is that the persistence &ndash; i.e., long-term
identification and access &ndash; of any information resource &ndash; i.e., an &ldquo;object&rdquo; &ndash; is a matter of
service.</p>
<p>A stewardship promise must come from a current provider, which may not be the original assigner,
because an assigner simply cannot ensure persistence &ndash; either via object structure or via a naming
scheme. The ARK spec makes a distinction between the so-called &ldquo;memory institution&rdquo; that acts as a
name assigning authority (NAA) and thus associates an identifier with an object, and a service
provider &ndash; a name mapping authority (NMA) &ndash; that actually stewards that information.</p>
<p>Without a description &ndash; &ldquo;a record bearing witness to the identifier&rsquo;s association with the object,
as recorded by a set of object characteristics&rdquo;<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &ndash; real identification is incomplete. A naked
identifier isn&rsquo;t enough &ndash; you need the record, the &ldquo;receipt.&rdquo; The name mapping authority &ndash; which
may be the same as the name assigning authority for as long as funding/politics allows &ndash; acts as
host, as steward.</p>
<p>Persistent identification (naked identifier plus description record) is separable from persistent
access. Description-only NMAs can redirect object-access requests to other NMAs, e.g. publishers
that restrict access to object content.</p>
<p>A key function of ARK&rsquo;s abstract model is for a service to deliver not only a descriptive metadata
record, but to deliver also a policy declaration: a declaration of permanence for each serviced
object &ndash; its availability, identifier validity, content invariance, and change history. <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/ma05/ma05_archive.html">NLM
&ldquo;permanence levels&rdquo;</a> are an example of
such declarations.</p>
<p>On a practical level, ARK facilitates the distinction between name mapping and name assigning via
the anatomy of a typical ARK:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>https://&lt;nma&gt;/ark:&lt;naan&gt;/&lt;assigned_name&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above is highly simplified. <code>&lt;naan&gt;</code> is the name assigning authority (NAA) number, i.e. the the
opaque number assigned to the NAA. <code>&lt;nma&gt;</code> is the name mapping authority &ndash; <code>n2t.net</code> is commonly
used, just like <code>doi.org</code> is commonly used for resolving DOIs. <code>https://</code> is common, though ARK is
an abstract model with no concretions around use of e.g. JSON or even HTTP.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> Finally,
<code>&lt;assigned_name&gt;</code> can reflect object hierarchies and qualifiers for variants (versions, formats,
etc.), all in ways formally given in the ARK spec.</p>
<p>A memory institution names objects with identifiers like <code>ark:12345/x2fr5</code>, and any number of NMAs
may serve access to the named objects and/or to their descriptions. Just like your web browser
discovers an IP address for a given domain name, your browser can discover one or more NMAs
servicing a NAAN namespace and thus an ARK. This can work even if a preferred NMA is given but is
not available, e.g. the ARK is presented as <code>https://example.org/ark:12345/x2fr5</code>.</p>
<p>ARKs are kind of like DOIs, but you can assign names freely under your assigned NAAN, you can
migrate your object repository to any NMA at any time, and NMAs can be explicit to users about
multi-faceted persistence policies on a per-object basis, all while guaranteeing permanence of the
&ldquo;naked&rdquo; (string) identifier.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Imagine a data system modeled as three parts: an interface, a processor, and a repository. The
repository &ldquo;contains&rdquo; information. The processor receives symbol streams to alter or retrieve
information from the repository, and the processor outputs symbol streams. The interface is the
medium, the opaque surface, of symbol-stream exchange between you and the processor.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>What information is &ldquo;in&rdquo; the repository? If data depends on a continuous variable, like time, the
actual things stored may be &ldquo;breakpoints&rdquo;, so that extracting data is a combination of
lookup-plus-compute. You may get a value for temperature at the precise time of an observation, but
the value is not stored – it is interpolated.</p>
<p>What is the difference between fetching a stored data structure and dynamically generating a record
with the same characteristics? The distinction between repository and processor is not so clear.
Data structures are snapshots of process; a repository is, in a way, a cache.</p>
<p>Just like it is more expensive to rework a product on an assembly line at the end as opposed to at
the beginning, it is more expensive to adapt a data product for a second application the more it has
been structured for a first application.</p>
<p>In scientific research, published data products are often structured for &ldquo;manuscript applications,&rdquo;
so repurposing the data requires reverse engineering PDF-embedded figures/tables or
spreadsheet/notebook-embedded formulae, annotations, and charts.</p>
<p>Data structures that embody snapshots of processing are valuable – they reduce latency for
predictable data requests for known applications. To maximize FAIR<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> characteristics of your
data, though, look upstream.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>After my last note on identifiers, Leo Talirz pointed me to a great riff<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> on Tim
Berners-Lee&rsquo;s classic note<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> on &ldquo;cool URIs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Cool DOIs&rdquo; article, Fenner breaks down a DOI into three parts: proxy, prefix, and suffix. A
proxy is a server that maintains a map from prefixes to registrants. Example proxies are
<a href="https://www.doi.org/">https://doi.org/</a> and <a href="https://hdl.handle.net">https://hdl.handle.net/</a>. An
example prefix is <code>10.5281</code>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281">https://doi.org/10.5281</a> and
<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/10.5281">https://hdl.handle.net/10.5281</a> thus should return the same
information: that given a DOI with prefix <code>10.5281</code>, e.g. <code>10.5281/ZENODO.31780</code>,
<a href="https://datacite.org/">datacite.org</a> is the registrant from which you can resolve the full DOI.
Thus, when you ask for <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.31780">https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.31780</a>,
the <a href="https://www.doi.org/">https://doi.org/</a> proxy looks up <code>10.5281</code> and tells your web client to
ask datacite.org for a URL corresponding to <code>10.5281/ZENODO.31780</code>. The URL is at zenodo.org,
meaning folks at zenodo.org registered the DOI with datacite.org.</p>
<p>McMurry et al.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> characterize a URI-as-identifier in a similar manner: as resolver, prefix,
and local ID. A resolver can be a &ldquo;primary&rdquo; resolver, e.g. doi.org, but it can also be a so-called
&ldquo;meta-resolver&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, e.g. <a href="https://identifiers.org/">identifiers.org</a> or
<a href="https://n2t.net/">n2t.net</a>. You register a prefix with a meta-resolver,  and you also register
resolution providers for your prefix. For example, someone registered the <a href="https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/doi">doi
prefix</a> with identifiers.org, along with a resolution
provider with URL pattern <code>https://doi.org/{$id}</code>. Because identifiers.org and n2t.net share
registrations, you can ask for
<a href="https://n2t.net/doi:10.5281/zenodo.18003">https://n2t.net/doi:10.5281/zenodo.18003</a>, which
meta-resolves to <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18003">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18003</a> via
URL pattern filling, and doi.org takes it from there. Another registered prefix is
<a href="https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/uniprot">uniprot</a>, with provider patterns
<code>http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/{$id}</code> and <code>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/{$id}</code> (so a
meta-resolver can try an alternative if the primary provider is down).
<a href="https://identifiers.org/uniprot:A0A022YWF9">https://identifiers.org/uniprot:A0A022YWF9</a> or
<a href="https://n2t.net/uniprot:A0A022YWF9">https://n2t.net/uniprot:A0A022YWF9</a> yield the same result.
<code>uniprot:A0A022YWF9</code> is an example of a so-called compact URI (CURIE).</p>
<p>With meta-resolvers, you have semantic flexibility in your choice of prefix. Fenner emphasizes that
DOI prefixes should be random and opaque because registrant/organization names can change. With
meta-resolution, if UniProt changes their name, they can register a new prefix and encourage its use
while still supporting the <code>uniprot</code> prefix. However, local IDs should be unique. My title for this
note reflects this revision: cool local unique identifiers (&ldquo;LUIs&rdquo;<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>) don&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Berners-Lee&rsquo;s note gives sage advice related to rolling your own resolver for LUIs via a server
hosted at a domain name you control. For semantically flexible prefixing, qualify everything with
creation date. The precision of this date can reflect an acceptable cadence for updates: for
research data projects, I think month-level precision, e.g. <code>/YYYY/MM/</code>, is acceptable. Thus,
<code>https://&lt;domain&gt;/2021/06/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;LUI&gt;</code> reads as &ldquo;ask <code>&lt;domain&gt;</code> for the record for <code>&lt;LUI&gt;</code> under the
namepace <code>/2021/06/&lt;org&gt;</code>, i.e. from the data repository that, in June 2021, <code>&lt;domain&gt;</code> knew by the
name <code>&lt;org&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>You can register these <code>https://&lt;domain&gt;/YYYY/MM/&lt;org&gt;/</code> namespaces as prefixes with meta-resolvers
and/or within your data products (e.g. as prefixes in RDF serializations). For a given <code>/YYYY/MM/</code>
qualification, your organization <code>&lt;org&gt;</code> can reflect the semantic partitioning strategy du jour (or
rather, du mois), e.g. {<code>/YYYY/MM/mp/calculations/</code>, <code>/YYYY/MM/mp/materials/</code>,
<code>/YYYY/MM/mp/structures/</code>,&hellip;}. The important thing here is that each such prefix is merely an alias
for a permanent and semantically opaque repository ID within <code>&lt;domain&gt;</code>, akin to the <code>10.5281</code>
example for DOIs.</p>
<p>This leaves us, at last, to LUIs. For these, I agree with Fenner&rsquo;s note and with Geewax<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>:
use random integers encoded with <a href="https://www.crockford.com/base32.html">Crockford&rsquo;s Base32</a> and a
checksum. For example, using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/base32-lib/">base32-lib</a> Python packaged

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(id_encoded2)  <span style="color:#75715e"># tw0t-ywdj-94 </span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the example, I specify the total length of encoded strings to be 10 characters, including 2
characters for the (ISO 7064, MOD 97-10) checksum. Thus, strings decode to 40-bit integers &ndash; 8
characters * (log2(32) = 5) bits/character. There are 2**40 ~ 1 trillion possible LUIs.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s nice about base32 encoding is that you can insert optional dashes anywhere for readability.
Here I insert one every 4 characters, yielding LUIs like <code>tw0t-ywdj-94</code>. The encoding is also
case-insensitive, and excludes the letters <code>I</code>, <code>L</code>, and <code>O</code>, because they can be visibly confused
with the numbers <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> &ndash; when decoding, a supplied letter <code>O</code> will be replaced with the
number <code>0</code>. The letter <code>U</code> is also excluded to avoid accidental obscenity.</p>
<p>You can use up to 12 characters (14 with checksum) for encoding up to ~ 1.1 quintillion (10**18)
LUIs and still store them internally as 64-bit integers. I think that my 8-character (12 with
checksum and dashes) example above is a good tradeoff for compactness and cardinality &ndash; you can
always create another repository under your domain, e.g. for transient/internal LUIs.</p>
<p>Finally, I do recommend recording your LUIs in an index so that collisions during generation, while
unlikely, are thwarted. Being able to encode LUIs as integers can help ensure fast index lookups.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Data protocols vary over project lifetimes, and many projects involve parameter sweeps. You might
see filesystem directory structures evolve naming schemes like the following<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># let&#39;s not overthink this at first.
concentration_A_0.25/
# hierarchy is good, right?
concentration_A/0.25/
# paths are getting too long.
conc_A/0.25/
# change to percentages. clever!
conc_A/25/
 # add a parameter
conc_A/25/temp_08/
# switch order, add another parameter
temp_08/conc_A/25/conc_B/05/
# ...
</code></pre><p>Or perhaps such decisions about hierarchy are reflected in a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; filesystem, e.g. you see one or
more of {<code>_</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>} as parameter delimiters in longer filenames, rather than <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>You certainly need to track where data came from and how to reproduce it. And it&rsquo;s convenient to be
able to visually compare two points in a state space without a lot of eye movement. Rather than
compare e.g. JSON documents that each take a large on-screen area to display, you want to compare
compact labels that each express a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key">composite key</a> in
the state space.</p>
<p>However, this composite key can change over the lifetime of a project as new parameters/dimensions
are added to the state space of measurements. You need flexible, adaptable labeling of data objects.</p>
<p>Labeling, however, is different than identification. What makes a good identifier? It should be easy
to use (i.e., to read/share/verify), unique, permanent, fast and easy to generate, and
informationally dense (i.e. compact). In addition, if security is a concern, it should be
opaque/unpredictable (so people can&rsquo;t guess IDs they aren&rsquo;t given).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Salient attributes here are <em>permanent</em> and <em>fast and easy to generate</em>. If you need to <em>think</em>
about what your identifiers should look like, there&rsquo;s a good chance you will find yourself
<em>re-thinking</em> your decision. This means not only that your identifiers will not be permanent, and
thus you need to deal with migrations, but they may be <em>not</em> fast and easy to generate because (a)
not all components of your composite key may be recorded yet for a given data object, or (b) minting
new identifiers is awaiting a new decision about your naming scheme.</p>
<p>Labels, on the other hand, can change over time. They can accumulate, each preferred by a given
audience due to spoken language and/or domain expertise. One label can be marked as preferred for
display by default in a given user interface.</p>
<p>Such labels can certainly be information-dense composite keys, facilitating rapid and text-based
recognition by eye of an object record without needing to look at <em>all</em> the metadata associated with
an object ID. Flexible labeling supports good identifiers.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Approaches to data citation may span classes of big-O complexity, for both space (memory/storage)
and time (compute/transfer).</p>
<p>Dataset revisions may be minted and persisted without any delta encoding / structural sharing. The
main mechanism of reproduction for citations in this case is restoration. Space complexity is high,
as storage needs are high. Cost of storage can be reduced via tiered storage / compression, yielding
increases in time complexity for restoration.</p>
<p>Opposite to restore-centered revision control is query-centered revision control for which space
complexity is not proportional to the number of minted revisions, but rather is proportional to the
total amount of information recorded across time. Rather than via copy-on-write, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data
structures</a> are achieved via delta encoding
/ structural sharing, akin to git&rsquo;s approach to revision control for codebases.</p>
<p>With query-centered revision control, the main mechanism of reproduction for citations is querying.
Space and time complexities can be balanced here in different ways. For example, one can maintain
multiple covering indexes that result in lower time complexity &ndash; faster queries &ndash; at the cost of
higher space complexity for the functional degeneracy.</p>
<p>There can also be interplay between restoring and querying. There may be structural sharing among
dataset revisions, but a particular revision may need to be &ldquo;restored&rdquo; for it to then be queried.
Alternatively, a &ldquo;change log&rdquo; may be queried directly, with an overlay filter that restricts results
to be consistent with a target version of the dataset.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The hourglass model is an approach to layered system architecture where a middle layer is
intentionally constricted in order to support flexibility in the implementation of layers above and
below. Above the <em>spanning layer</em> are <em>applications</em>, and below the spanning layer are <em>supports</em>.</p>
<p>Beck (2019) provides a formal analysis of the hourglass model.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> His Hourglass Theorem
conveys that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a weaker layer specification has fewer possible applications but more possible supporting layers
than a stronger layer specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/today/fair-digital-framework/">GO FAIR initiative</a> is trying to
identify a plausible hourglass approach to infrastructure for FAIR data and services:</p>

<p>Their labeled <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/resources/internet-fair-data-services/hourglass/">hourglass
icon</a> (reproduced above)
gives a good sense of the tradeoff. The spanning (exchange) layer needs to be strong enough to
facilitate a minimal variety of useful services, but must also be weak enough to facilitate the
greatest possible variety of supporting data that services can suck up through the straw.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Against what bases are queries against your data evaluated? If you only expose a single &ldquo;data base&rdquo;
that changes over time, then data citations cannot be a combination of query and basis.</p>
<p>When citing a passage in a book, the edition/variation of its publication, i.e. the thing that is
assigned an ISBN, is the basis. Optionally, a citation may include a &ldquo;query&rdquo; against this basis &ndash; a
page number, page range, chapter number/title, etc. Yes, part of the passage may be copied inline as
a quotation, but a reader can use the provided query and basis to evaluate a cited passage in
context.</p>
<p>One way to support granular data citations is to allow people to share both their queries against
your data and the bases against which those queries were evaluated. These (query, basis) pairs can
be assigned IDs so that citations can be shared compactly. This allows people citing your data to
avoid the equivalent of quoting tens of pages of a book inline to ensure their readers can examine
that text.</p>
<p>But how are multiple bases maintained, single bases restored for queries, and queries executed, all
with reasonable space and time complexity? There are a variety of approaches, each with their
tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Have you undertaken such an endeavor, dear reader? Let me know about your experience.
In a follow-up note, I&rsquo;ll go over some approaches I&rsquo;ve encountered.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Many tests use <em>oracles</em>, where you know the answers for some inputs and you check those
correspondences.</p>
<p>To cover more of the input state space, you can generate random inputs and check some properties for
each corresponding output. You don&rsquo;t have an enumeration of exact answers like with oracles, but you
can check things like the output always being greater than zero, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, it&rsquo;s hard to assert properties of individual outputs that, across your state
space, hold for their inputs &ndash; it may be easier to assert <em>output relationships</em> across the space.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have a function \(f_a\) to compute some property of your input using method
\(a\), and another function \(f_b\) to compute that same property using method \(b\). Your
domain model tells you that method method \(a\) systematically underestimates the property value
relative to method \(b\), which is more accurate; you may use method \(a\) anyway for many inputs
because it&rsquo;s much more computationally efficient than method \(b\).</p>
<p>You can assert the metamorphic relation \(f_a &lt; f_b\), and test on that,
even when it&rsquo;s hard to test via oracles or properties &ndash; imagine in our example that it&rsquo;s hard to
determine output values a priori, and that it&rsquo;s also hard to even set upper or lower bounds on
individual outputs given their inputs.</p>
<p>While a lot of property-based testing highlights data-(structure-)specific properties, the positing
and testing of metamorphic relations can help you highlight domain-specific properties that hold
regardless of lower-level data representation. A good overview of metamorphic testing is
<a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/metamorphic-testing/">here</a>, and an article on application to
testing bioinformatics programs is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-10-24">here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In a collaboration, data objects are produced at many sites. To make the data objects findable, you
may steward a central, searchable index for their metadata. How then do you make the data objects
accessible for download?</p>
<p>One common solution is to centralize the custodianship &ndash; have all sites upload copies of their data
objects to a central store. The central store may partition storage across several physical servers
behind the scenes (e.g. an Amazon S3 bucket), but it is still logically a single store, managed by a
single custodian.</p>
<p>What about collaborative custodianship? This seems apt when the total volume of data is very large,
especially compared to the &ldquo;active&rdquo; volume in use at any given time. In this scenario, it seems
important to allow custodian sites to (1) only serve data to members of the collaborative, and (2)
use tiered storage.</p>
<p>One solution that could work here is to have a central registrar where sites register their data
objects as URIs, along with any required request headers and/or a required POST body. A site can
later update any data object&rsquo;s registration.</p>
<p>When a user in the collaborative wants a data object, they can be given the necessary request info,
along with a one-time bearer token if authorization is required. When a site receives a request, it
can confirm the token validity with the registrar before servicing the request. As a side effect of
token confirmation, the registrar can also compile usage statistics on behalf of each site.</p>
<p>As for accommodating tiered storage, it seems that having sites implement a variant of Amazon S3&rsquo;s
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html">RestoreObject</a> API would
work well. For example, if a data object is available but not immediately accessible, the site gives
a 202 Accepted response, with an operation ID in a header for checking status via follow-up HEAD
requests. If a restore is already in progress, the response to a duplicate request is a 409
Conflict. And if retrieval is unavailable, a 503 Service Unavailable response with a Retry-After
header can allow a user agent to try again. In any case, once an object is available, a 303 See
Other response can direct a client to GET it from where it has been restored.</p>
<p>Are you part of a data collaborative with distributed custodianship? If so, how does that work, and
what about the system works well versus not as well?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>One powerful mechanism of robustness is exploratory behavior, for which the desired outcome is
produced by a generate-and-test mechanism.</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/generate-and-test.png" width="100%" alt="generate-and-test" title="generate-and-test"/>
<br/>
<p>This organization allows the generator to work and be developed independently of the tester that
accepts or rejects a particular result. One can make an analogy to biological evolution, where the
generator is random mutation and the tester is natural selection.</p>
<p>We may try a similar organization in our programs. Property-based testing tools can generate
proposals from specifications, and design-by-contract tools can test contract clauses for
implementations.</p>
<p>Here is an example in Python, which I&rsquo;ve adapted from <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/pbt-contracts/">this
post</a> by Hillel Wayne:</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/icontract-hypothesis-1.png" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<p>The <code>icontract</code> library is our design-by-contract tool. We use the <code>require</code> decorator to require a
precondition of invoking the function, and we use the <code>ensure</code> decorator to ensure a postcondition
after the function has returned.</p>
<p>The <code>hypothesis</code> library is our property-based testing tool. We import its strategy mechanisms for
generating lists and integers for our tester.</p>
<p>Our generator of test cases is independent of the contract guarding the function under test, which
in turn is independent of the implementation of the function.</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/icontract-hypothesis-2.png" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<p>Running <code>pytest</code>, we uncover a contract violation via a test case generated by hypothesis.</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/icontract-hypothesis-3.png" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<p>We can filter/qualify our hypotheses with assumptions.</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/icontract-hypothesis-4.png" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<p>Our fuzzer has unearthed another violation. This time, we choose to change the implementation rather
than add an assumption to the generator.</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/icontract-hypothesis-5.png" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<p>Now, we get nudged to acknowledge the impact of our stated assumptions.</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/icontract-hypothesis-6.png" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<p>And we decide to explicitly opt out.</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/icontract-hypothesis-7.png" width="100%"/>
<br/>
<p>Given that research software often supports the real-world generation of hypotheses and testing of
models &ndash; where models must implement observation-determined &ldquo;contracts&rdquo;, I hope this quick example
hints at how tools for property-based testing and design-by-contract can complement each other and
help you lessen the semantic gap between physical research activities and the software artifacts
that support them.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Resource description refers to defining concepts and relationships that represent the content and
structure of some subject matter (ontology) or a database (schema) in a formal language. The
relationship between ontology and database schema is nuanced &ndash; Uschold provides a nice
comparison.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> You can formally describe resources using the resource description framework
(RDF), SQL&rsquo;s data definition language (DDL), etc.</p>
<p>Resource layout refers to the arrangement of resources and their relationships for a particular
resource-oriented API.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The layout isn&rsquo;t <em>intrinsic</em> &ndash; it refers to choices regarding what

<p>Not every conceptual resource needs to &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; to be an API resource &ndash; some may end their
journey at the point of becoming only in-lined data types of other resources (Do you need to
atomically interact with a concept?). Hierarchical relationships (i.e. containment/ownership) may
make sense when there are cascading actions or inherited access policy / properties.</p>
<p>Resource layout, as a layer on top of resource description, is an opportunity to make the common
case awesome &ndash; without compromising the feasibility of advanced cases &ndash; for a particular

<![CDATA[<p>In the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
(<a href="https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html">OAI-PMH</a>), a <em>repository</em> is a means
of exposing metadata to <em>harvesters</em>. The OAI-PMH spec goes into great detail about how a data
provider should implement a repository so that a harvester can simply be a client application that
issues one of six possible HTTP requests. However, we often want to harvest metadata from
repositories that&hellip;well&hellip;they&rsquo;re not OAI-PMH repositories.</p>
<p>Many potential sources of scientific metadata are delimited-path key-value systems such as object
storage, e.g. AWS S3, and file systems, e.g. SCP-accessible UNIX directories. How might such
&ldquo;repositories&rdquo; be mapped to an OAI-PMH interface for harvesting?</p>
<p>In OAI-PMH, an <em>item</em> is a unique key within a repository that can yield a metadata <em>record</em> about a
<em>resource</em>. In AWS S3, a bucket is a repository, a key in that bucket is an item, and the object the
key points to is the resource. Using the S3 API, you can get a metadata record for a key, and the
format of that record is customizable &ndash; e.g. you can ask for different kinds of metadata.</p>
<p>For a shared filesystem directory, the directory is the repository, a file path relative to the root
directory is an item, the bytes of a file are a resource, and you can get different metadata records
about a file, e.g. different aggregations of file attributes (last-modified, size, ownership, etc.).</p>
<p>Importantly, an <em>item</em> in OAI-PMH &ldquo;is conceptually a container that stores or dynamically generates
metadata about a single resource.&rdquo; Using that idea, one could define
<a href="https://statecharts.github.io/">statecharts</a> in the form of so-called &ldquo;path machines&rdquo; that traverse
the components of a delimited path (e.g. a synthetic &ldquo;event&rdquo; sequence of
<code>bucket-&gt;my-&gt;meaningful-&gt;path-&gt;to-&gt;something.json</code> for the S3 key
<code>s3://bucket/my/meaningful/path/to/something.json</code>) and maintain extended state to build up a
metadata record that is the machine&rsquo;s output.</p>
<p>In OAI-PMH, a metadata record is identified unambiguously by the combination of three things: the
item identifier, the timestamp of the record, and an identifier for the format of the record.
Analogously, a record harvested by a path machine would be identified by the (fully-qualified) path,
the timestamp to associate with the record (e.g. the last-modified stamp for a S3 key), and the id
of the path machine used to generate the record.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Do your programs only compute pure <em>functions</em> of data, or do they also perform <em>effects</em> such as
dynamically reading input, writing output, transitioning database state, making network requests,
etc.?</p>
<p>One sense of the term &ldquo;logic&rdquo; is as a general subject, i.e. the study of how to draw valid
conclusions. Another sense is as a particular language, i.e. <em><strong>a logic</strong></em> for representing
information along with a set of inference rules that specify exactly what conclusions can be drawn
from what premises.</p>
<p>To ensure the reliability of your functions and of your data at rest, you may use type annotations,
assertions, database system affordances such as schema declarations, etc. Ideally, these tools help
you express both your domain logic and your application-specific logic.</p>
<p>Statecharts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> are a formal extension of finite state machines for modeling stateful, reactive
systems. Extensions include guarded transitions, managed effects, extended state (context),
orthogonal (parallel) states, and hierarchical (nested) states. The formalism has been standardized
as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/">SCXML</a>. <a href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/">XState</a> is a popular
implementation that adheres to SCXML while providing a JSON syntax and execution via
JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>
<p>Statecharts help to ensure a logic of effects. Effects are managed and executed by the system; you
needn&rsquo;t execute them within your functions, i.e. as &ldquo;side-effects&rdquo; of a function&rsquo;s transformation of
input to output. In the taxonomy of statechart effects, there are &ldquo;fire-and-forget&rdquo; effects such as
<em>actions</em> and <em>activities</em>, as well as &ldquo;invoked&rdquo; effects such as <em>promises</em>, <em>callbacks</em>,
<em>observables</em>, and other <em>machines</em> that can send and receive events to/from the invoking
statechart.</p>
<p>Crucially, a statechart interpreter cancels the execution of / discards the results of effects when
there is a finite state transition &ndash; this logic is managed by the system. And unlike finite state
machines, a statechart can have &ldquo;extended state&rdquo;, i.e. context. In other words, you can have an
&ldquo;infinite&rdquo; state space as long as you carve your universe of state into a finite number of
partitions; you might say that a statechart is a partitioned-state machine. This partitioning
facilitates a logic of managed effects.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Shared datasets often have column/field names that are ambiguous in their meaning, or contain
identical/related concepts with different names, hindering reuse. This ambiguity happens regardless
of the method of sharing &ndash; via files, web pages, or APIs. The traditional solution for this is to
provide documentation.</p>
<p>However, documentation is typically delivered “out-of-band”, i.e., not directly linked within the
same artifact (file/object) as the data. Furthermore, any linking among terms by different data
providers, whether to assert equivalence or to clarify differences, is typically done in an ad hoc
manner, hindering interoperability and thus reuse.</p>
<p>I am getting started with a <a href="https://github.com/marda-dd/docs">working group of materials
scientists</a> to develop data dictionaries using Linked Data
principles. I&rsquo;d like to highlight one feature of the HTTP standards that is helpful in serving both
human-readable and machine-readable documentation for data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In HTTP, <em><strong>content negotiation</strong></em> is the mechanism that is used for serving different
representations of a resource at the same URI, so that the user agent can specify which is best
suited for the user (for example, which language of a document, which image format, or which content
encoding).
<br/>— <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation">MDN Web Docs</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say we have a data dictionary identified as
<a href="https://ns.polyneme.xyz/2021/04/marda-dd/test#">https://ns.polyneme.xyz/2021/04/marda-dd/test#</a> with a contained term
<a href="https://ns.polyneme.xyz/2021/04/marda-dd/test#helloWorld">https://ns.polyneme.xyz/2021/04/marda-dd/test#helloWorld</a>. When you click on the link in a web
browser, your user agent (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.) assumes you want a response in the
&ldquo;text/html&rdquo; format. However, if you are accessing the resource programmatically, you may want a
different format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># A readable, hand-editable RDF format (&#34;turse [sic] triples&#34;)</span>

consumers scrape web pages, find links by eye to obtain different formats, or remember your
convention for how to alter a URL to obtain the desired resource &ndash; it&rsquo;s the same resource, just a
different representation.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>When you have several different applications (e.g. to perform simulations and analyses) that each
have their own data model, it&rsquo;s typical for each to also maintain its own siloed data store. Then,
in order to use all the applications in concert to complete a research project, or to support an
ongoing research program, you need to run extract-transform-load (ETL) pipelines to sync the data.</p>
<p>In the best case for such an application-centric architecture, you may have a central data store
with which each application-specific store performs ETL. In the worst case, you have quadratic
growth of point-to-point ETL.</p>
<p>Even if every application&rsquo;s data is technically in the same store (e.g. a &ldquo;data lake&rdquo;), each
application&rsquo;s data model can be arbitrarily different from the others&rsquo;, necessitating custom
transformations to be implemented and maintained over time.</p>
<p>In this scenario, ETL is a symptom of data diseconomy. You may recognize and budget for &ldquo;technical
debt&rdquo; when optimizing for expediency in developing a given application, perhaps to hit a conference
deadline. This debt is at the code level. However, beware also of &ldquo;integration debt&rdquo; at the data
level if adding a new software tool with an arbitrarily different data model.</p>
<p>What is an alternative to ballooning ETL efforts? Though it takes discipline, a data-centric,
(data-)model-driven architecture is a way out of the quagmire.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a catchy-acronym substitute for ETL &ndash; perhaps cache, map, cache (CMC), where bookend
caching is optional, an incidental performance optimization. That is, one can federate virtualized
queries that map at query time, e.g. via the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/">R2RML</a> standard if a
given application needs to work with data in a tabular form rather than the document/graph form of a
central data store. The &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; is just one of form &ndash; the underlying data model is shared across
all applications.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I was reading about hidden costs of &ldquo;packaged&rdquo; software solutions &ndash; that is, using existing
software to solve problems &ndash; and came across this sentence:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the packaged solution saved some money on development, they more than made up for it in
implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh? I typically do not distinguish <em>development</em> from <em>implementation</em>. What McComb is calling
&ldquo;implementation&rdquo; I just call &ldquo;installation&rdquo;. Weird.</p>
<p>He goes on to detail the following activities needed to &ldquo;install&rdquo; a packaged solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Configuration</em>. This can conceivably be nestled under &ldquo;installation&rdquo;, but some software has hundreds or thousands of flags/settings, many of which may influence each other, making this a complex activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Modification or extension</em>. If the package doesn&rsquo;t do <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do, you need to modify or extend it. If you find you need to modify it, note that introducing a change late in a system&rsquo;s lifecycle is typically way more complex than doing it early. And you are doing it as late as possible!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Integration</em>. The cost of integrating the new thing with existing systems can be huge: multiply the number of existing touch points by the number for the package, and multiple again by the complexities of each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Data conversion</em>. The package likely has a data model that is arbitrarily different from the one you have in place. In addition to the data being structured differently, does the new system have different ideas about data integrity and validation? Does it require new data?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Change management</em>. Are there new screens? New terms/labels? A new implicit/explicit work flow? A need for a whole slew of new workarounds? You may need to retrain people to use a system that isn’t on the whole easier, just different.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow. Although &ldquo;configuration&rdquo; can conceivably be nestled under the term &ldquo;installation&rdquo;, the
modification/extension, integration, data conversion, and change management activities are better
subsumed by &ldquo;implementation&rdquo;! Consider yourself lucky if/when you are able to simply &ldquo;pip install&rdquo;
and lightly configure a package without needing to do any of the above.</p>
<p>Can you simply &ldquo;install&rdquo; that package? Or will you need to <em>implement</em> it? To what extent does the
existing wheel fit your vehicle?</p>

<![CDATA[<p><a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/how-is-data-unification-different-than-data-fusion/">Earlier this
week</a>, I wrote
that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In sharing scientific research data, the goal is often to provide data reductions to the extent
possible without loss – the output is, in a strong sense, equivalent to the input. Any further
reduction that may be necessary to support decisions and policy can be done as fusion beyond
unification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As luck would have it, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) posted a funding opportunity announcement
(FOA) yesterday on <a href="https://science.osti.gov/-/media/grants/pdf/foas/2021/SC_FOA_0002501.pdf">Data Reduction for
Science</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientific observations, experiments, and simulations are producing data at a rate beyond our
capacity to store, analyze, stream, and archive. This data almost always contains redundancies and
trivialities that hide the important information of interest to scientists. Of necessity, many
research groups have already begun reducing the size of their data sets&hellip;These efforts should be
expanded to include mathematical rigor to ensure that scientifically-relevant constraints on
quantities of interest are satisfied, to be integrated into scientific workflows, and to be
implemented in a manner that inspires trust that the desired information is preserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been efforts for decades to identify and deal with this issue, with cute acronyms for
relevant data like ROT (Redundant Obsolete and Trivial), WORN (Write Once Read Never), and WORSE
(Write Once Read Seldom if Ever). However, the DOE FOA highlights that it is not enough to
<em>separate</em> storage (&ldquo;hot&rdquo;, &ldquo;cold&rdquo;, etc. tiers) for research data &ndash; we must seek to <em>avoid</em> storage
of ROT data.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>If you share data on the web as delimiter-separated values &ndash; that is, as spreadsheets &ndash; there is a
world of power-ups available to you.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;sidecar&rdquo; is used for a functional addition. A motorcycle sidecar can carry things and
people. A Kubernetes sidecar container has access to the namespace and storage volumes of it&rsquo;s pod&rsquo;s
main container, and so supports auxiliary work. Unstructured documentation, e.g. a typical README
file, is not a sidecar.</p>
<p>The W3C&rsquo;s &ldquo;CSV on the Web&rdquo; (CSVW) working group published <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csvw">seven
documents</a>, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-csvw-ucr-20160225/">a note on 25 identified use
cases</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/NOTE-tabular-data-primer-20160225/">a
primer</a> on effective use of its
recommendations in practice. In the simplest case, when you&rsquo;re serving a csv file like <code>mydata.csv</code>,
you also serve a JSON sidecar by adding <code>-metadata.json</code> to the name (e.g.
<code>mydata.csv-metadata.json</code>), and you use the CSVW vocabulary to provide extra information about your
data.</p>
<p>There are limits to the logic you can express using the CSVW vocabulary, and this is reasonable (cf.
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html">&ldquo;rule of least power&rdquo;</a>)! The Shapes Constraint
Language (SHACL) vocabulary extends expression of logic to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-shacl-js-20170608/#h-js-functions">JavaScript
functions</a> (Python functions seem
doable&hellip;) &ndash; this could help to transform a spreadsheet&rsquo;s cell values to conform to a desired
schema.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In response to <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/tenets-of-scalable-data-unification/">this note</a>, a
reader asked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is data unification different than data fusion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I re-read the Stonebraker whitepaper I had linked to in that note, and what it describes does <em>not</em>
seem meaningfully different than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_fusion">data fusion</a>.</p>
<p>I propose that data unification is more conservative than data fusion &ndash; it stops short of the lossy
reduction often required for decision-support systems.</p>
<p>From the Wikipedia article on data fusion linked above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; data integration is used to describe the combining of data, whereas data fusion is integration
followed by reduction or replacement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, Stonebraker&rsquo;s 6th Tenet expresses the need for irreversible reduction (fusion) with
acceptable confidence via machine learning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A rule system implementation will not scale. Only machine learning systems can scale to the level
required by large enterprises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decisions are often made using methods other than logical reasoning, i.e. &ldquo;going with your gut&rdquo;.
Machine learning allows decision-makers to model gut-like reasoning quantitatively over large data
sets when expert-supplied domain logic is insufficient to reduce the data without loss.</p>
<p>The example given in the whitepaper is that 500 rules were able to classify only 2M records out of
20M, so machine learning was used to make educated guesses about the remaining records.</p>
<p>In unification, no guessing is permissible. Rather, additional user input is solicited. For example,
with type inference, a compiler does not &ldquo;train&rdquo; on the types you explicitly annotate, plus the ones
it can infer with 100% confidence, in order to assign guesses to what remains. Rather, though it may
guess, it requires user input to confirm guessed types. Until the type checker is 100% confident,
the unification process does not fuse.</p>
<p>Thus, I view Stonebraker&rsquo;s contention that a rule system implementation will not scale as saying
that, if a data application requires classification of all records, even in the absence of logical
certainty based on supplied domain rules, then data unification is insufficient, and data fusion is
required &ndash; 100% logical certainty is sacrificed, but decisions must be made today, and the best one
can do is track provenance and report some quantification of the confidence.</p>
<p>In sharing scientific research data, the goal is often to provide data reductions to the extent
possible without loss &ndash; the output is, in a strong sense, equivalent to the input. Any further
reduction that may be necessary to support decisions and policy can be done as fusion beyond
unification.</p>

<![CDATA[<p><em>Unification</em> is a process of combining partial-information structures. First used in computing for
theorem proving,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> it is used widely for <em>type inference</em> in programming-language compilers and
for logic-programming systems.</p>
<p><em>Data unification</em> is described well in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s75l3y17df1scja/Seven-Tenets-of-Scalable-Data-Unification-2019-01.pdf?dl=0">this
whitepaper</a>
by Stonebraker. It is concerned not just with ingest, cleaning, and transformation generally, but
also specifically with schema integration, deduplication (entity consolidation), and
classification.</p>
<p>One of the examples problems he gives is of unifying data from 10,000 electronic lab notebooks for
Novartis, a large drug company. This is an &ldquo;enterprise company&rdquo; problem, and he outlines seven
tenets of data unification for situations at this scale.</p>
<p>I think the tenets also apply to dealing with the scale of scientific research data. Because it&rsquo;s
often a tiny research group attempting unification rather than a large business unit, attention to
such tenets may be even more critical.</p>
<p>If you get a chance to read the whitepaper, let me know what you think.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Values like &ldquo;3&rdquo; are typically considered separately from <em>constraints</em> like &ldquo;&lt; 10&rdquo; or <em>types</em> like
&ldquo;number&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What if these were all on equal footing as values in a hierarchy? &ldquo;3&rdquo; is an instance of &ldquo;&lt; 10&rdquo; is an
instance of &ldquo;number&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A lattice is a partially ordered set, in which every two elements have a unique least upper bound
(join) and greatest lower bound (meet). In a value lattice, &ldquo;constraints&rdquo; and &ldquo;types&rdquo; <em>are</em> values,
with &ldquo;is a&rdquo; as the partial order.</p>
<p>What this means, for example, is that if you use a value lattice to represent schemas, you can
always unambiguously merge multiple schemas independently of order &ndash; the most general mutually
compatible schema is the unique greatest lower bound. You can also infer a schema/template for data
entry from concrete instances &ndash; that would be the least upper bound. Finally, validating new data
against the current schema and verifying that a new schema is backwards compatible with the current
schema is the same operation &ndash; is the former an &ldquo;instance of&rdquo; the latter?</p>
<p>Using a value lattice, there is no need for configuration/schema files to mutually import each other
within a package or project. Files can be split across organizational lines, each with a different
set of policies. There may also be an opportunity here for collaborative data querying. Whereas
validating data is the problem of finding data that is inconsistent with some constraints, querying
is the problem of finding data that matches some given constraints. Clearly these two concepts are
related.</p>
<p>For a deeper dive into value lattices and tooling to incorporate them into your work, check out the
<a href="https://cuelang.org/docs/concepts/logic/">CUE project</a>. Portions of my note here were lifted
directly from the linked page, as I did not feel they could be improved upon!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Do you repeatedly define the same field/attribute across different classes / entity types? For
example, you may have many different entities with an &ldquo;id&rdquo;, a &ldquo;name&rdquo;, etc. When an attribute
&ldquo;belongs to&rdquo; an entity, you need to repeatedly register specifications for each (re)definition: it&rsquo;s
a string, it needs to pass these tests to be considered valid, etc.</p>
<p>What if attributes were top-level? That is, you define them once and then freely associate them with
entities. This schema can be at the domain level, whereas application of attributes to define
entities can happen at the (well-named!) application level.</p>
<p>Applications can evolve independently of an upstream attribute schema, as each application entity is
an aggregation of attributes for a known execution and data context: for this process/function, what
attributes are required, and what does &ldquo;valid entity&rdquo; mean in this context?</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/schema/schema.html#attributes">Attribute specs</a> may include an
identifier, value type (string, number, etc.), cardinality (either one or many values),
documentation, whether a value is unique across all entities, whether a value uniquely identifies
its entity, and validation functions.</p>
<p>When attribute specs are reused, entities are relieved of potentially inconsistent and error-prone
re-definition of attributes. Entity specs are then higher-level: they are about required attributes
and about entity-level validation &ndash; constraints across attributes in the entity and perhaps across
other entities in the system.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Consider &ldquo;basic theories&rdquo; that are particularly simple in two ways.</p>
<p>First, they describe selected aspects of material objects, abstracting from all other properties &ndash;
homogenous samples, thermally isolated containers, points, rigid solids, infinitely thin layers,
etc.</p>
<p>Second, they provide particularly simple expressions and means of combination for their simple
objects. For example, the theory of electric circuits has basic elements such as resistors,
batteries, and capacitors, described by simple expressions like \(RI\) or \(q/E\), with sequential
chaining of resistors \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) described by summation: \(R_1 I + R_2 I\).</p>
<p>Scientists use multiple basic theories to construct models because physical systems are usually too
complex to be effectively described by application of a single theory. In most cases, observed
behavior can only be explained when we consider many types of interactions by combining different
theories and applying them jointly to a complex structure.</p>
<p>In equation-driven analytical modeling, one uses basic theories as &ldquo;FAIR components&rdquo; of the model.
Simple objects are identified, expressions are accessed, and these expressions interoperate via
arithmetic combinators in systems of equations.</p>
<p>Żytkow and Lewenstam, in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/73dljyj0b5muwpe/Zytkow%201990%20-%20Analytical%20chemistry%3B%20the%20science%20of%20many%20models.pdf?dl=0">&ldquo;Analytical chemistry; the science of many models&rdquo;
(1990)</a>,
go into depth on what I&rsquo;ve outlined thus far (I highly recommend it!), and the diagram below
showcases this equational-model-building process:</p>
<br />
<img src="/img/zytkow-modeling.png" width="100%" alt="building a model" title="building a model"/>
<br/>
<p>I believe that data-driven computational modeling has a lot in common with equation-driven
analytical modeling. Just as analytical modeling benefits from the interoperable combination of
basic theories, computational modeling can benefit from available digital resources that are
unambiguously scoped &ndash; via metadata &ndash; as applicable to particularly narrow objects, situations,
and processes.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In order to integrate quantitative data, you need to know (a) if units are commensurate, and (b) if so, how to do
conversions.</p>
<p>The Quantities, Units, Dimensions, and Types (QUDT) ontology serves three major purposes. First, it provides a global
reference for units via URIs; this helps avoid tacit conventions that are prone to misinterpretation. Second, it
provides for dimensional analysis via so-called &ldquo;quantity kind&rdquo; dimensional vectors; you can determine that each side of
an equation resolves to &ldquo;length over time squared&rdquo;, for instance. Third, it provides for unit conversions.</p>
<p>Below is a concrete example of the kind of metadata available in QUDT. It is represented in the Turtle format for (I
hope) better readability than JSON, but this is easily converted to JSON.</p>
<p>The dump below is to facilitate me pointing out a few concrete features. First, notice that the &ldquo;Acceleration&rdquo; quantity
kind is linked to known applicable units across systems of units (Imperial, SI, etc.). Second, notice that
&ldquo;Acceleration&rdquo; links to a dimension vector that expresses an exponent of 1 for length and -2 for time, i.e. &ldquo;length over
time squared&rdquo;. Finally, notice that each unit has a conversion multiplier relative to a common base unit (so it&rsquo;s not
important to know what that base unit is); some units also have a conversion offset, e.g. Celcius (unit:DEG_C) has a
qudt:conversionOffset of 273.15.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite features of the PyCharm code editor is
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/navigating-through-the-source-code.html#go_to_declaration">go-to-declaration</a>:
you can hold the control key and hover your mouse over a usage of a symbol, and you&rsquo;ll see a tooltip with a preview of
the declaration/definition of the symbol. Click it, and you&rsquo;ll jump to the definition, perhaps in another file. After
you&rsquo;ve reviewed the definition, a keyboard shortcut gets you back to the usage point. You can do the same thing for the
type of a symbol, using shift-control instead of just control.</p>
<p>Other code editors have this capability, of course. It&rsquo;s doable because your usages of symbols unambiguously link to
their definitions. They have to, or the code wouldn&rsquo;t run.</p>
<p>Is your data structured so that you can straightforwardly provide go-to-definition links/tooltips in a web API/GUI
presenting your data? If not, how might you get there?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The RDF data model is quite flexible: Anybody can say Anything about Any topic (aka the &ldquo;AAA slogan&rdquo;). However, I
recommend &ndash; and describe here &ndash; a particular modeling strategy when it comes to entering new facts about research
activities into a data management system. Once entered this way, workflows may add additional derived facts to suit the
needs of downstream applications. This strategy has been called <em>entity-event modeling</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PbuPyeR5Aw">in the context of RDF
graphs</a>, and is a specialization of the broader <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event
sourcing</a> pattern.</p>
<p>First, identify one or two &ldquo;core continuants&rdquo; for your domain, where a continuant is something that continues to exist
throughout some period of time, as distinguished from an &ldquo;occurrent,&rdquo; which is anything that may be said to occur and
that is associated with one or more continuants. These core continuants should be suitable as principal subjects across
applications &ndash; they are domain-specific, not application-specific.</p>
<p>For example, a microbiome data collaborative may posit a &ldquo;study&rdquo; activity as a core continuant, which is influenced by
events relating to generation of environmental bio-sample entities, communication with sequencing- and
annotation-workflow activities, and association with various human or software agents.</p>
<p>The W3C provenance (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-dm-20130430/">PROV</a>) data model, a vocabulary with a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-o-20130430/">mapping
to RDF</a>, is a great fit for continuant-event modeling. At its core,
PROV describes the use and production of <em>entities</em> by <em>activities</em>, which may be influenced in various ways by <em>agents</em>
(such as people). Crucially, the distinction between activity and entity in PROV is similar to that between
<a href="http://www.ditext.com/johnson/intro-3.html">&lsquo;continuant&rsquo; and &lsquo;occurrent&rsquo;, respectively, in logic</a>. A so-called
&ldquo;prov:Activity&rdquo; may be a subject of ongoing concern, i.e. a continuant: generating, using, and invalidating entities;
being triggered to start or end by entities; associating with agents (that in turn may have roles or plans, or may
delegate to other agents); and communicating with other activities via shared entities.</p>
<p>Depending on your domain, your &ldquo;core continuant&rdquo; may be any of prov:Activity, prov:Agent or even prov:Entity. Think
about the most important set of &ldquo;continuing&rdquo; subjects across many instantaneous occurrences, i.e. across many
observations of state. For a <a href="https://microbiomedata.org/">multi-omics data collaborative</a>, the core subject may be a
study (a prov:Activity). For a <a href="https://materialsproject.org/">collection of data on all known inorganic materials</a>, the
core subject may be a &ldquo;material&rdquo; (a prov:Entity with many specializations, i.e. alternate structures). For many service
businesses, the core subject may be a customer or patient (a prov:Agent).</p>

<![CDATA[<p>It is hard to mediate among concrete representations, among data structures with differing schema. There are certainly
valiant efforts to <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">replicate shared data structures without conflict</a>
and to facilitate <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria.html">distributed schema evolution</a>, i.e. to sync &ldquo;under the
hood&rdquo; concerns.</p>
<p>Alan Kay&rsquo;s original vision of &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo; design is analogous to the &ldquo;cell-oriented&rdquo; operation of a human being,
in that questions of concrete representation are postponed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Every cell in our bodies is a descendant of a single zygote. All the cells have exactly the same genetic endowment
(about 1GByte of ROM!). However there are skin cells, neurons, muscle cells, etc. The cells organize themselves to be
discrete tissues, organs, and organ systems. This is possible because the way a cell differentiates and specializes
depends on its environment&hellip;context that selects particular behaviors from the possible behaviors that are available in
its genetic program.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In distributed computing systems with a <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">log-centric
architecture</a>,
each individual service (&ldquo;cell&rdquo;) has the same genetic endowment &ndash; the shared log of events. Each service is a state
machine that can respond to the event log differently, and thus exhibit different behavior. At any time, a service can
be &ldquo;re-built&rdquo;, perhaps using different logic, that re-plays the same event log to do its thing.</p>
<p>In a scientific data collaboration, each actor specializes in acting on and producing data in a particular way. If all
input and output is cast as a log of simply-structured events, as a shared and growing sequence of nucleotides (and with
a growing number of distinct &ldquo;types&rdquo; &ndash; not just A, T, G, and C &ldquo;events&rdquo;!), then each actor can draw upon a shared
genetic endowment for its activities, even as those activities may change over time &ndash; as actors differentiate.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Have you ever given or gotten data as CSV? Are the meanings of the columns always clear? How are they made clear? Are
the given column labels/names and the given file/sheet names always enough?</p>
<p>If additional information beyond the CSV file is needed, how is that facilitated? A separate README file that travels
with the CSV as part of a zipped archive file? What happens when the archive is unzipped and the CSV gets shared via
email without the README also attached? Whoops.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to keep data together with its schema and context. Links help. It&rsquo;s great when a scientific article links out
to references via unambiguous DOIs. It&rsquo;s great when a web page with an embedded data table links out to another web page
for more context.</p>
<p>JSON-LD makes JSON data Linked Data. What would &ldquo;CSV-LD&rdquo; look like?</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;CSV-LD&rdquo; was previously used to describe a <a href="https://github.com/gkellogg/csv-ld">now-obsoleted precursor</a> to the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page">CSV on the Web (CSVW) metadata specifications</a>; both approaches require a
second file, a JSON-LD template document, to be shared along with a CSV file.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m preparing a talk for <a href="https://csvconf.com/">csv,conf</a> in May about an approach that, in contrast, requires only a
CSV file from the data producer, one that includes links to CSVW-powered metadata. It is primarily intended to be a way
to use Linked Data as part of spreadsheet-based data entry; to facilitate data validation, display, and conversion of
CSV into other formats via use of CSV on the Web (CSVW) metadata; and to build FAIR data services.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>If you provide JSON, either as files or as API responses, you might be one step away from ensuring that anyone
encountering that JSON has a portal to what it means. This step is to provide a single extra key-value pair in each JSON

<p>JSON-LD is &ldquo;a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed

<![CDATA[<p>You have a variety of entities, each with a variety of attributes, and each involved in a variety of relationships.</p>
<p>One approach to manage such data is a collection/spreadsheet/table approach where you partition your entities. Each
entity has a primary address in a document/row in one collection/sheet/table. In that document/row, you will find its
ID, unique perhaps only in conjunction with the name of its collection/sheet/table of residence, plus the name of the
enclosing set-of-collections/sheets/tables.</p>
<p>In the partitioned-entities approach, an entity&rsquo;s attributes may be co-located with the entity in its document/row.
Relationships are expressed via &ldquo;foreign keys&rdquo;, references to entities in other collections/sheets/tables via their IDs.
And the name of the foreign entity&rsquo;s collection/sheet/table of residence may not explicitly be recorded in this slot,
but rather may depend on application code or on database code that maintains schema awareness.</p>
<p>The partitioned-entities approach can become unwieldy with increases over time in variety &ndash; of entities, attributes,
and relationships. When you recognize a new &ldquo;kind&rdquo; of entity, it could live in an existing named partition
(collection/spreadsheet/table). Your application code could then apply a predicate function over entity attributes to
say whether it&rsquo;s of the new kind or not. You could also cache such evaluations in a &ldquo;tags&rdquo; field in the document/row &ndash;
but it may be unwise to let this field grow without bound. How big can a single document/row be in your system? This
document/row-size concern also comes into play with an increasing number of attribute fields for an entity.</p>
<p>The new kind of entity could also live in a new named partition (collection/spreadsheet/table). With increases over time
of relationships of interest among entity types, it can become unwieldy to answer questions that span these
relationships. This is because queries will involve multiple joins that require knowing the primary residences of
entities (because their IDs are not universally unique, just within their residence namespaces) and where various
attributes live as well (i.e. the types of entities to which they &ldquo;belong&rdquo;).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard to build robust systems: systems that have acceptable behavior over a larger class of situations than was
anticipated by their designers. The most robust systems are evolvable: they can be easily adapted to new situations with
only minor modification.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> There is a more robust approach to manage and query data that are likely to grow in
variety regarding types/labels/tags of entities, their attributes, and their relationships. This approach is based on a
universal relation &ndash; one table, and one table only. In this approach, ingress is (or is isomorphic to) the RDF model
for encoding a graph of knowledge, and query/egress is (or is isomorphic to) Datalog. Databases such as Datomic, Grakn,
and TerminusDB focus on this approach, and many other databases can be configured to support it.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>If you write a program that references a variable, and that variable points to a value, you likely don&rsquo;t want that value
to change unless you&rsquo;re doing the changing. This gets tricky when you want to bring in more resources to help you get
the job done faster &ndash; you might still be in control of the program, but the &ldquo;you&rdquo; in action may be multiple
cores/threads.</p>
<p>It can be hard and frustrating to revert to blocking and explicit hand-offs in your code: the performance gains might be
slight, or even if things run faster, your mental bandwidth in understanding more-complicated code and tracking down
subtle bugs might be significant, so is it really worth it?</p>
<p>Data sharing can be hard like shared variables can be hard. You want to get work done faster by bringing in more
(human + machine)
resources, and by always having up-to-date data across a collaboration, but you don&rsquo;t want data changing out
from under you while you&rsquo;re in the middle of running an analysis.</p>
<p>There are techniques to facilitate code concurrency on data with fewer headaches, and I think some of these techniques
can be adapted to facilitate concurrency among scientific-data collaborators.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>How do you check potential changes to your published data?</p>
<p>You might set a rhythm for releases, say monthly or quarterly. You generate a new release candidate, run a set of
checks, and then release. You reproduce the whole thing rather than add to it, and you do your checks at the end.</p>
<p>You might do incremental rather than batch processing. You apply changes to your last release, run checks, and then
release. You either (a) apply changes to a full copy of the last release, or (b) you have version control and can apply
changes to a new branch of the data without maintaining a separate copy and without disrupting references to the
release.</p>
<p>When applying potential changes, you might also apply them in sequence as a pipeline with checks at each stage, rather
than / in addition to checks at the very end.</p>
<p>Your pipelining may use entirely bespoke software, or it may use software with maintenance shared across a community,
such as <a href="https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/">FireWorks</a>, <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Airflow</a>, or
<a href="https://dagster.io/">Dagster</a>. Similarly, your data checking may use entirely bespoke software, or it may use shared
software such as <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/">Great Expectations</a> or built-in facilities of pipelining software (e.g.
enforced typing on step inputs and outputs in Dagster).</p>
<p>How do you stage and check potential changes to your published data? I&rsquo;m curious about what you&rsquo;ve done / seen done /
are doing in practice, and if your current practice feels sufficient.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Git is the common tool for version control of code. How does it work? It works by grouping events about lines. Lines are
added or removed, and a group of add/remove events is a transaction, i.e. a &ldquo;commit&rdquo;. A sequence of these
line-delta-group events can be replayed from the log to construct a snapshot of the codebase at any point in the commit
history.</p>
<p>Replaying a totally ordered log to construct a snapshot of state, i.e. state machine replication (aka &ldquo;event sourcing&rdquo;),
is an increasingly popular practice in distributed data systems. Git does this for line-delta encodings of collections
of text files, i.e. the stream of atomic changes to your codebase. Too bad your database isn&rsquo;t a set of files of
plaintext lines.</p>
<p>What is your database a set of? Can you delta-encode atomic changes to that set?</p>
<p>Documents and tables can be represented as graphs  &ndash; sets of edges, with each edge connecting two nodes. Thus, an edge
could be the equivalent of a line. Shards of a graph (or separate named graphs) could be the equivalent of files. An
edge ledger, an accounting of the assertion and retraction of edges, could be the log, with atomic commits of sets of
edge events.</p>
<p>Databases like Datomic and TerminusDB do this today. Pervasive version control for data could enable scientists to more
unambiguously cite a dataset (e.g. as the result of query Q pointed at commit C of data repository R) and to collaborate
without fear on data repositories (&ldquo;Oops, I messed up, let&rsquo;s undo that last data commit. Here&rsquo;s an updated commit.
Great, now the data passes the automated tests &ndash; let&rsquo;s push an official release.&rdquo;).</p>

<![CDATA[<p>We often think of provenance as a physical thing, tracking the history of a sample and of what we measured. But the
provenance of a result started when someone had the idea or the request to measure it. The metadata for a result is not
just the parameters on the instrument, or how much sample, or which sample &ndash; it&rsquo;s all those other steps upstream.</p>
<p>Conceptual metadata are like tags, meaningful handles. In a research environment, they allow you to find things based on
a concept as opposed to e.g. having to know that it was Jim that ran this on Thursday and Jim always puts his results in
this folder. In the absence of conceptual metadata, the best search algorithm you have is often your personal network &ndash;
having to know who typically runs this kind of thing and then asking them where it&rsquo;s stored. In a research environment
where (a) there&rsquo;s a fair bit of turnover (students graduating, postdocs moving on), and (b) we have a lot of stuff done
outside our team, e.g. through transient collaborations, that personal-network algorithm gets harder and harder to rely
on. So it results in the repetition of experiments.</p>
<p>When conceptual context &ndash; describing planned experiments, methodologies, sample prep, execution of measurement,
calculated/reduced results &ndash; lives in separate systems, you have orphaned context and meaning separate from the
ultimate results. So, in order to bring information together in a report/presentation, or to fully describe and record
the findings for something like a publication or filing, somebody has to read from one system and type or copy/paste
stuff into another. There are compounding opportunities for human error, dropping units, putting things in the wrong
blank, typing strings that are non-standard, etc. This makes for a very fragile and tenuous handle on the conceptual
provenance of a measurement/result.</p>
<p>At any given point in a research workflow, we know a lot about our stuff. Somebody in our electronic universe knows what
we need to know &ndash; perhaps we just haven&rsquo;t enabled an electronic flow of that context to capture with the data. This is
useful not just for integration for indexes and search downstream, but it also ensures that context, no matter who comes
and goes from the team, is more or less permanently embedded with the data.</p>
<p>(I borrowed <em>heavily</em> from <a href="https://www.bioradiations.com/data-standardization/">this fantastic podcast episode</a> &ndash;
check it out.)</p>

<![CDATA[<p>How do you effectively share a computational process?</p>
<p>You could simply share a directory of source code and rely on shared conventions &ndash; shared programming language, shared
tooling for build and runtime environments, a README.txt convention for communicating setup instructions, etc.</p>
<p>You could go further and use e.g. a container runtime+image protocol such as that published by the Linux Foundation&rsquo;s
Open Container Initiative (used by Docker et al.). Necessary context is less likely to be missing.</p>
<p>Finally, you could share infrastructure such as a platform to run containers. Necessary context is even less likely to
be missing.</p>
<p>What about sharing data?</p>
<p>You could share a directory of files and rely on shared conventions &ndash; field names, file types, a README. You might
provide a modicum of helpful context via the HTTP protocol and shared infrastructure (the Web) by hyperlinking to
remotely hosted resources in your README.</p>
<p>You could use a container protocol like the Data Package of the <a href="https://frictionlessdata.io/">Frictionless Data
toolkit</a>. With an ecosystem of tooling, necessary context is more likely to be &ldquo;obviously
not missing&rdquo; rather than merely &ldquo;not obviously missing&rdquo;. If you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;contain&rdquo; all your data+context, Linked Data
protocols such as JSON-LD and CSV for the Web (CSVW) build off the HTTP protocol and shared Web infrastructure.</p>
<p>For further assurance that a data consumer isn&rsquo;t missing context, you can use infrastructure such as the
<a href="https://goodtables.io/">https://goodtables.io/</a> service for continuous validation of GitHub-or-S3-hosted spreadsheets (compatible with
Frictionless-Data-protocol formats), or use the so called <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2020/Dec/13/datasette-io/">&ldquo;Baked Data&rdquo;
pattern</a> exemplified by the <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette
project</a> and <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/meao/2018/03/28/bedrock-the-sqlitening/">Mozilla.org</a>
(another &ldquo;contain it all&rdquo; approach based on continuous re-deployment of of a read-only database, e.g. a single-file
SQLite database).</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t contain all the data+context you need to share in one place &ndash; i.e. when data sharing means data
collaboration, then I suggest infrastructure based on Linked Data &ndash; <a href="https://data.world/">https://data.world/</a> and <a href="https://terminusdb.com/">https://terminusdb.com/</a> are
two examples &ndash; that embraces your data being part of a Web &ndash; not necessarily part of &ldquo;the&rdquo; Open Web, but a Web
nonetheless, with a basis on protocols like HTTP and DNS and on existing network infrastructure supporting those
protocols.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>You have a data-intensive research problem. Custom software will help you solve it. Code is written. A dataset is
collected to feed the code. Did you just create another silo?</p>
<p>What would it mean to be data-centric, with only one data platform and with applications on top, where applications come
and go?</p>
<p>In your group, who decides what kind of database to use? If you give a student a task, and say to please go solve it,
they&rsquo;re going to pick the easiest tool to use. Off they go, and after some time the task is done. They&rsquo;ve created a new
silo, a siloed dataset or application. They didn&rsquo;t think about how their new application is going to work with every
other application relevant to your group. That was not their role. They just got the task to solve a specific problem.
They&rsquo;ll publish an article, mint DOIs for the dataset and codebase, and that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>Are you perpetuating a culture of creating a new silo for every problem? At the core of the Semantic Web is the notion
of caring deeply about identity, the identity of objects. For intelligent data integration, you have to be sure that you
give the same thing the same name, and you need clear mechanisms to relate things. You can&rsquo;t ask group members to make
these decisions on their own.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Centralization&rdquo;. &ldquo;Mapping&rdquo;. These are overloaded concepts. They mean different things in different contexts. One
hawk-eyed reader has rightly cried Ambiguous! on my usage of these terms in recent notes.</p>
<p>In Democracy in America, de Tocqueville &ldquo;distinguishes between centralized government, which concentrates common
interests like foreign relations or general laws, and centralized administration, which concentrates local interests
into one place.&rdquo;
[<a href="https://www.litcharts.com/lit/democracy-in-america/chapter-5-decentralization-in-america-its-effects">ref</a>]
Centralization in governance, in coordination (including for tractability of certain analyses), and in
registration/indexing/search, is not the same as centralization in administration and situation of resources.</p>
<p>The domain-domain &ldquo;mappings&rdquo; I had in mind in my last note are what are termed &ldquo;functors&rdquo; in category theory. In
un-namespaced natural language, so-called synthetic names such as &ldquo;functors&rdquo; are more narrow than so-called natural
names like &ldquo;mappings&rdquo;, but authors risk losing (a subset of) readers in any insistence on One Name for a concept.</p>
<p>A strength of Linked Data is in celebrating a plurality of narrow terms as namespaced URIs. A natural term needn&rsquo;t be
replaced with a synthetic canonical one &ndash; we have things, not strings, and we can relate things via the RDF model of a
triple - <subject> <predicate> <object>, where each component is a URI &ndash; a thing, not a string.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to back away for now from attempting to explicate my thoughts on open- vs closed-world logic, in part because
it seems particularly difficult to do so with brevity without opening serious gulfs of ambiguity, given the serious
formal attention such concerns have garnered for decades. For a deeper dive relevant to this audience, I highly
recommend a <a href="https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2020/09/04/the-open-world-assumption-considered-harmful/">recent article</a>
by Chris Mungall.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Scientific data is distributed over time. For a given entity of interest, have we already recorded all potentially
relevant data on its properties, relationships, and representations? Have we already enumerated all of an entity&rsquo;s
potential attributes for which to slot in such data? Have we already named all possible types of entities of interest in
our domain?</p>
<p>An &ldquo;open-world assumption&rdquo; can ease data interoperability over time in a domain, as applications come and go.</p>
<p>In a closed-world data model, if an entity is not in the database now, it doesn&rsquo;t exist (perhaps it will in a &ldquo;later&rdquo;
world, but not this one). A closed-world model facilitates validation, which is important in applications.</p>
<p>In an open-world model, if an entity is not in the database now, it may exist &ndash; we can&rsquo;t claim it doesn&rsquo;t. However, an
open-world model shines at deductive inference of true yet not-explicitly-entered facts, which is helpful in knowledge
domains (and downstream applications).</p>
<p>I drafted a diagram below to try and illustrate the benefit of open-world modeling for domain data.</p>
<p><img src="/img/open-world-closed-world_bubbles.png" width="100%"
alt="open-world/closed-world bubbles - easy flow across domains, versus necessary mapping" /></p>
<p>With open-world domains, interdisciplinary data flow doesn&rsquo;t require explicit domain-domain data mappings. Rather, each
domain can set up its own inference rules to deduce mappings for datasets. Once in the language of a domain, each
application in that domain can &ldquo;close the world&rdquo; with a validation funnel for data relevant to the application.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when domain models are tightly coupled to identified applications, the world closes early, and
explicit mappings are needed to share structure-bound data.</p>
<p>I offer one additional diagram below to illustrate a difference in processing for closed-world and open-world domain
data. For closed-world data X, one maps that data to domain/application Y; it may &ldquo;grow&rdquo; or &ldquo;shrink&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s a
transformation. For open-world data, on the other hand, there is first an inference step, where the set of facts grows.
Then, for any given application, the data shrinks on validation for the world of the application.</p>
<p><img src="/img/open-world-closed-world_boxes.png" width="100%"
alt="open-world/closed-world boxes - map (grow or shrink) versus infer (grow) + validate (shrink)" /></p>
<p>This turned out to be a long note. Bad Donny. But I hope I got across a sense of a means to decouple domain
data/knowledge management from application data management, and of how this decoupling could be valuable in particular
for the (conceptual + temporal) open-endedness of interdisciplinary scientific research.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Scientific data is fundamentally distributed: physically, conceptually, and temporally.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t situate all the data you&rsquo;ll ever need, once and for all, in one place. There will always be another source of
data. And another. Centralization doesn&rsquo;t work for large, global enterprises like modern science. Even
command-and-control corporate enterprises have gone from data warehouses to data lakes (still centralized, but less
stringently organized) to data meshes (decentralized!). Connection and flow among data nodes is key.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the data that&rsquo;s distributed &ndash; the concepts are, too. People use different names for the same thing, the
same name for different things, &ldquo;kinda-the-same&rdquo; names for &ldquo;kinda-different&rdquo; things&hellip;oy. From the Zen of Python
(<code>import this</code>): &ldquo;Namespaces are one honking great idea &ndash; let&rsquo;s do more of those!&rdquo; In Python code, I can have something
like &ldquo;from pymatgen import Structure&rdquo; at the top of a file and know that when this module talks about Structure, it&rsquo;s
talking about it in the sense specified by the python materials genomics (pymatgen) package.</p>
<p>Data needs similar means for disambiguation. In the RDF data model, each concept is a URI, like
<a href="https://schema.org/unitCode">https://schema.org/unitCode</a> (which one might &ldquo;import&rdquo; by registering
&ldquo;<a href="https://schema.org/">https://schema.org/</a>&rdquo; as a default namespace, or as the prefix &ldquo;scm:&rdquo; and then using
&ldquo;scm:unitCode&rdquo;, etc.). Furthermore, RDF graphs (cf. knowledge graphs) provide additional disambiguation power in placing
concepts within a directed graph in which relations (edges) among concepts (nodes) are also unambiguously named URIs.</p>
<p>This note is getting a bit long, so I will defer treatment of the nature and implications of the temporal distribution
of scientific data to a separate note.</p>
<p>Are you sufficiently convinced that centralization, both for physical data instances and conceptual data-attribute
definitions, is untenable for modern collaborative research? Let me know.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I have written a bit about benefits of FAIR; however, a reader rightly pointed out to me that there is no such thing as
a free lunch &ndash; what are some of the costs of FAIR?</p>
<p>Below is my first stab at a diagram that I hope distinguishes some costs and benefits of FAIR, and how they are related,
in the case of building an &ldquo;inside track&rdquo; for an existing research-information lifecycle.</p>
<p><img src="/img/fair-hub-and-spokes.png" width="100%"
alt="FAIR Hub-and-Spokes" /></p>
<p>The outer rim represents an existing workflow of activities typical for a research project cycle in your lab. These
activities include planning, gathering, producing, tagging, reviewing, analyzing, integrating, publishing, distributing,
etc. The exact activities and their ordering doesn&rsquo;t matter here. What matters is that there are a number of identified
steps (18 in the diagram), and some are not actually done  &ndash; either they are hard to consistently do well, or they are
doable but are laborious and the cycle would take too long if they were included (so only 10 of the 18 in the diagram
are actually done).</p>
<p>The inner rim represents a new workflow, one that uses FAIR infrastructure and that serves as a hub for outer-rim
concerns. The benefits I hope the diagram conveys are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your new workflow has fewer (human-executed) activities. Instead of 10 steps, there are 6 steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your new workflow does more. The 6 steps do what would have taken you 18 steps before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth of data mappings among activities is linear because an activity need only map to a common data model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope also that the diagram shows costs in various forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some activities may need to change in order for them to &ldquo;do more&rdquo; behind the scenes (via automation). I represent
this cost as thicker circles for activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connecting what you&rsquo;re doing to what machines are doing is also a cost: the cost of integration. Sometimes,
integration is cheap because of existing standards/tools that are easy for you to use. Other times, you need to develop
&ldquo;glue&rdquo; code to connect existing tooling to your special activity, shown in the diagram as a dot at either end of an
integration edge. Finally, you may need to incur the cost of fully custom integration, shown in the diagram as thick
integration edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your workflow is a simple linear cycle, then your collection of data mappings among activities already grows only
linearly; developing a shared data model, shown in the diagram as a central axle point, is a cost without clear benefit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This post was a bit long, but I hope the diagram helps you consider the benefits of FAIR infrastructure in relation to
its costs. I feel that many of the costs can be shared across a community with differing research workflows but common
activity types. Let me know what you think.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Findability is making reuse possible. If no one can discover your data, if even basic metadata is hidden in a silo, then
reuse is simply not possible.</p>
<p>Accessibility is making reuse plausible. People and their designated software agents can not only identify relevant
resources via metadata, but they can actually retrieve full data for inspection and evaluation.</p>
<p>Interoperability is making reuse probable. Not only is your data findable and accessible, but there is not too heavy a
burden on someone to make your data compatible with their own data and processing tools. Your data is accessible in an
open, standard format. You include a schema with the data, preferably in a machine-actionable format as well. An
interested consumer is significantly more likely to bite.</p>
<p>Reusability, finally, is making reuse…perishable. Using a food analogy, let’s say you have identified a potential
ingredient for a recipe (findability); you know it is in stock at a nearby store (accessibility); and you have
determined that it is indeed suitable for use with your kitchen tools, other ingredients you have on-hand for the
recipe, etc. (interoperability). Finally, you can bring it home to your kitchen&hellip;but will you actually be able to use
it?</p>
<p>The warranties on and terms of use for data &ndash; its licenses &ndash; are important; these are analogous to “best by” dates,
expiration dates, etc. on food. The reusability concern of FAIR does not guarantee reuse, but it again increases the
likelihood of reuse because the terms and conditions of reuse are made more explicit &ndash; a consumer of your data can make
a decision to reuse with more confidence. Data with no license is like a food product with no expiration date &ndash; does
that mean it’s forever usable, or will someone likely be unsure and thus put your data in the trash bin?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A format describes what your content &ldquo;is&rdquo;; a model describes what your content is &ldquo;about&rdquo;. Is-ness issues will affect
people’s ability to use your data (it&rsquo;s not informative if it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;in formation&rdquo;), but about-ness is at the core of
analysis.</p>
<p>CSV and JSON are formats. SQL and RDF describe models.</p>
<p>What is your data &ldquo;about&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Is it about rectangular entities, each with a fixed number of attributes/columns, with cell references pointing to rows
of other rectangles? SQL models rectangular data.</p>
<p>Is your data about documents, each a tree structure that contains sub-document data? The document object model (DOM)
that your browser applies to every webpage is a fine example.</p>
<p>Is your data about named entities, each with a variable number of attributes and relations to other entities? Perhaps
sub-graphs of your data can be presented in rectangle/table- or document-friendly formats, but your data is more &ldquo;about&rdquo;
a graph of entities, their attributes, and their relations. RDF models graph/relational data.</p>
<p>And how do you communicate the about-ness (model) of your data when you share it (in a format)? Does the model travel
with the data, or is it lost / nontrivial to look up (what does that column/field mean)?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to know how you are achieving (or struggling to achieve) the format/model distinction, and the sharing of both
for any given dataset.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The seminal <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18">article on FAIR</a> defines interoperability as &ldquo;the ability of data or
tools from non-cooperating resources to integrate or work together with minimal effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is the &ldquo;non-cooperating&rdquo; part important here? It is. You can think of this as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">adversarial
interoperability</a>, as distinct from &ldquo;indifferent
interoperability&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t care if you reuse this&hellip;for now) or &ldquo;cooperative interoperability&rdquo; (please reuse this&hellip;for
now). The term &ldquo;adversarial&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;evil&rdquo; &ndash; it means that a software agent acting on someone else&rsquo;s behalf isn&rsquo;t
&ldquo;on your team&rdquo;, and is allowed to pursue goals that may surprise you.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s play with etymology a bit. To coordinate is to &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo;, where &ldquo;ordinate&rdquo; shares a root with &ldquo;ordinal&rdquo;, i.e.
categorical ordering, taxonomic classification. To coordinate is to &ldquo;ordinate together.&rdquo; In particular, we might
&ldquo;co-elaborate&rdquo;/&ldquo;co-labor&rdquo; (collaborate) on data schema  and on sanctioned operations with data, i.e. we &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo;.
Inter-operation, on the other hand, is distinct from co-operation (i.e., &ldquo;intra-operation&rdquo;, within a group).</p>
<p>Why is such non-cooperative interoperability important? We have more data in the published literature than we know what
to do with, unless we use machines. We&rsquo;re still seeing data published in a way that 19th-century scientists  would
understand, rather than in a way appropriate to this century, with connectivity to electronic media and computing power.
Researchers need machine agents to &ldquo;read&rdquo; on their behalf, without prior coordination.</p>
<p>Does this make sense to you? Disagree vehemently? Let me know.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A &ldquo;knowledge line&rdquo;, aka &ldquo;K-line&rdquo;, is a representation of knowledge that connects what we know with how it&rsquo;s used &ndash; we
keep each thing we learn close to the agents that learn it in the first place.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> When a K-line is re-activated,
the agents attached to it are re-activated, putting a system in a &ldquo;mental state&rdquo; similar to when this thing we know was
last generated, used, and/or persisted.</p>
<p>A K-line &ldquo;memorizes&rdquo; the entities we&rsquo;re working with in part by making a list of the agents involved in our activities.
&ldquo;Re-membering&rdquo; is in part a recollection of agents &ndash; getting the band back together &ndash; to restore a working context.</p>
<p>K-lines may be facilitated by Linked Data standards. The PROV ontology focuses on <code>prov:Entity</code>, <code>prov:Agent</code>, and
<code>prov:Activity</code> classes and how these first-class concepts relate to one another. The RDF data model facilitates the
wire-like structure of K-lines as a graph, and PROV provides the controlled vocabulary and schema.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Imagine buying something in a store and having to remain there to use the thing. People want to find relevant data,
evaluate whether they can obtain and use it, and then &ldquo;take it home&rdquo; to their chosen environment &ndash; Excel, MATLAB, R,

<p>They don&rsquo;t want to have to learn your analytics tool / interface. Yes, you&rsquo;ve put a lot of effort into a science
gateway, and there are so many features and benefits for the user &ndash; the data is always up-to-date, you can pay
attention to their usage decisions (and the latencies of resultant operations) in order to improve user experience over
time, etc. This facility is akin to a separate room or lounge in a store where customers might be encouraged to get
started with their new purchase &ndash; a playroom.</p>
<p>Your online analysis environment is a nice-to-have &ndash; it may certainly lower the barrier to &ldquo;buying&rdquo; the data because a
user can kick the tires for a small part of their target application right then and there &ndash; but keep in mind that,

subsystems of a larger software solution should consider eschewing local data-management parochialisms in favor of the
<a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/LanguageSystem.md">language of the system</a>, so
should scientific researchers consider the impact of their parochial decisions about data structure on the potential for
sharing and collaboration.</p>
<p>Data collaboration is operations collaboration &ndash; joining the results of operations on shared data to achieve desired
outcomes using the union of capital resources from both organizations. The facilitation of data sharing is not enough &ndash;
you can build a filing cabinet, but it may remain empty.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>There are a number of reasons to punt on power in a design, to go with a
worse-is-better style such that you express the design in the least powerful
way.</p>
<h2 id="worse-is-better">Worse is Better</h2>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;worse is better&rdquo; comes from a talk by Richard Gabriel on the topic
of software specification.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> He introduces and compares two
philosophies of design, one he labels &ldquo;the right thing&rdquo;, and the other he labels
&ldquo;worse is better&rdquo;; he also uses labels referring to where exemplary systems for
each philosophy originated, but I&rsquo;ll refer to them here as the <em>right-thing</em> and
<em>worse-is-better</em> styles.</p>
<p>The worse-is-better style says that it&rsquo;s okay to put more work on an end user if
it means less work for the implementer: &ldquo;It is more important for the
implementation to be simple than the interface.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s okay to leave things out:
&ldquo;completeness must be sacrificed whenever implementation simplicity is
jeopardized,&rdquo; whereas for the right-thing style, &ldquo;simplicity is not allowed to
overly reduce completeness.&rdquo; As for consistency, in the worse-is-better style,
&ldquo;the design must not be overly inconsistent&rdquo;, whereas for the right-stuff style,
&ldquo;consistency is as important as correctness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worse-is-better is about a design that is maximally usable for a range of
implementers/operators while still being at least sort-of-okay for end users
of the deployed implementation/system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;C is&hellip;a language for which it is easy to write a decent compiler, and it
requires the programmer to write text that is easy for the compiler to
interpret&hellip;Both early Unix and C compilers had simple structures, are easy to
port, require few machine resources to run, and provide about 50%-80% of what
you want from an operating system and programming language&hellip;Half the computers
that exist at any point are worse than median (smaller or slower). Unix and C
work fine on them. The worse-is-better philosophy means that implementation
simplicity has highest priority, which means Unix and C are easy to port on such
machines.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important property of worse-is-better designs is that they can and sometimes
do become better over time, potentially serving as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation">disruptive
innovations</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is important to remember that the initial virus has to be basically good.
If so, the viral spread is assured as long as it is portable. Once the virus has
spread, there will be pressure to improve it, possibly by increasing its
functionality closer to 90%, but users have already been conditioned to accept
worse than the right thing. Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will
gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will
be improved to a point that is almost the right thing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-rule-of-least-power">The Rule of Least Power</h2>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee elaborates on a similar idea for choosing a programming
language:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The low power end of the scale is typically simpler to design, implement and
use, but the high power end of the scale has all the attraction of being an
open-ended hook into which anything can be placed: a door to uses bounded only
by the imagination of the programmer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is an important tradeoff between the computational power of a language
and the ability to determine what a program in that language is doing&hellip;if you
capture information in a simple declarative form, anyone can write a program to
analyze it in many ways&hellip;the less powerful the language, the more you can do
with the data stored in that language.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the more constraints you place on the power of what you deploy
to end users, the more you empower those end users to predictably build upon
what you&rsquo;ve delivered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;weather information conveyed by an ingeniously written [app]&hellip;might provide
a very cool user interface or other sophisticated features, [but] the results of
the program will not usually be predictable in advance. A search engine finding
the resource will have no idea of what the weather data is or even, in the
absence of other information, that it is a weather-related resource. The only
way to find out what [an app] means is generally to set it running, and see what
it does.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that leveraging the predictability of what you deploy may not be in a given
end user&rsquo;s skill set &ndash; it may not be a familiar activity, i.e. it is not (yet)
&ldquo;easy&rdquo; for them, despite the simplicity of the offering.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="as-simple-as-possible-but-no-simpler">As Simple as Possible, but No Simpler</h2>
<p>What is the appropriate &ldquo;least power&rdquo; for a system? A system needs to support
expression of simple explanations and predictions. Alan Kay talks about how
circles are not powerful enough to explain planetary motion
simply.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> &ldquo;Planet&rdquo; means &ldquo;wanderer&rdquo; in Greek &ndash; the motion of
planets was a mystery for centuries. Copernicus’s scheme &ndash; with the sun in the
center of the solar system rather than the earth &ndash; made things more tractable,
but it was still a mess of circles. Kepler made it simpler by going for slightly
more power via using ellipses rather than circles &ndash; ellipses were an
appropriate least power, finally supporting simple explanations and predictions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You get simplicity by finding a slightly more sophisticated building block to
build your theories out of.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is often desirable to scale power. For example, consider models of a water
molecule with different levels of expressivity, i.e. different levels of
explanatory power. One model could express only chemical composition, that there
are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, i.e. &ldquo;H2O&rdquo;. A more powerful model
could express logical structure, i.e. &ldquo;H-O-H&rdquo;. An even more powerful model could
express physical structure, i.e. the angle between two H atoms bound to O and
the relative size of H and O atoms. As elaborated in <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Just because one model is more expressive than another does not make it
superior; different expressive modeling frameworks are different tools for
different purposes. The chemical formula for water is simpler to determine than
the more expressive, but more complex, models, and it is useful for resolving a
wide variety of questions about chemistry. In fact, most chemistry textbooks go
for quite a while working only from the chemical formulas without having to
resort to more structural models until the course covers advanced topics.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Power scaling may be idiomatically encouraged within a more powerful language,
and may even be explicitly standardized.<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> For example, JSON is
a standardized use of a subset of the syntax of JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="less-power-via-functional-programming">Less Power via Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Functional programming (FP) may be seen as a discipline to scale down power
relative to object-oriented programming (OOP). Rafael Dittwald<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
characterizes FP and OOP via their respective takes on the expressive power of
referencing mutable state, mutating state in place, and side effects. While
powerful, these techniques can be confusing and difficult to reason about. OOP&rsquo;s
stance is not to constrain, but rather to organize, whereas FP&rsquo;s stance is to
minimize, concentrate (reduce the number of places where they occur), and defer
(have them happen later in a process, preferably via an underlying
system/runtime rather than via custom code). The tool in OOP to organize state
is objects, and a program can be seen as an interaction of agents. The tool in
FP is functions, and a program can be seen as a pipeline of input to output.</p>
<h2 id="less-power-via-plain-data">Less Power via Plain Data</h2>
<p>Plain data is less powerful that even &ldquo;pure&rdquo; functions - no behavior is
expressed. Often, data rather than code can be used to define/drive control
flow. This is data-driven programming, aka configuration-driven programming.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Transparency through data&rdquo;, James Reeves<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> posits that to build on
something, that something must be seen clearly: it must be transparent.
Transparency is about understanding, and understanding is about prediction. Code
that&rsquo;s easy to predict is transparent. In particular, the broader the
predictions we can make, the more transparent the code is. What makes something
predictable? Constraints. The more we constrain something, the broader the
predictions we can make about it. By empowering something, we make it more
opaque, less transparent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With great power comes great unpredictability.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine this &ldquo;function&rdquo; in Python defined using a dictionary:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>NOT <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {<span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>, <span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>: <span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>NOT[<span style="color:#66d9ef">True</span>] <span style="color:#75715e"># False</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>NOT[<span style="color:#66d9ef">False</span>] <span style="color:#75715e"># True</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Both the domain and co-domain of this function are transparent. It&rsquo;s clear on
inspection what input corresponds to what output. There is no additional
behavior, no function body, to interpret. It is predictable.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are the ellipses of text search. They are more sophisticated
than plain strings, but less powerful than code. Actually, a regex is still
quite powerful due to backtracking, and is guaranteed to halt only &ldquo;eventually&rdquo;.
<a href="https://github.com/google/re2j">RE2</a> supports a more constrained form of regex,
e.g. with no backtracking, guaranteed to halt in linear time. Less powerful,
more predictable.</p>
<p>Regular expressions are an example of a domain-specific language (DSL), a great
technique for deliberate downscaling of power. A language has syntax and
grammar, primitives and means of combining them, and a DSL can be expressed in
plain data. Regular expressions are a DSL for text search expressed as plain
string literals. Datalog is a DSL for database querying using plain scalar and
collection literals. The MongoDB languages for collection filters, projections,
and aggregation pipelines are all expressed as plain JSON.</p>
<h2 id="worse-able-environments-tuning-transparency">Worse-able Environments: Tuning Transparency</h2>
<p>If you want to use the least power necessary to solve a given problem, but you
don&rsquo;t want to switch programming environments all the time, you want a
worse-able environment, one that supports worse-is-better design by helping you
to self-impose constraints.</p>
<p>Below is my attempt at a diagram showing a spectrum of programming concepts from
least to most powerful, and thus from most to least predictable. This is an
elaboration of the saying, &ldquo;data &gt; functions &gt; macros&rdquo; (data over functions over
macros) in the Clojure community.</p>
<p><img src="/img/data-types-functions-macros_predictable-to-powerful.png" width="100%"
alt="Predictable to powerful: data > functions > macros." />
<br></p>
<p>Plain data is most predictable: it has no behavior, and its form doesn&rsquo;t change
over time. Slightly more powerful is a system that validates and conforms data
types, like one enforced by a compiler or other mechanism apart from
custom-written code. Such a system has some behavior (validation and
conformance/destructuring), but this behavior doesn&rsquo;t change over time, and the
behavior is specified &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo;, i.e. there is no need to manually track
evolving data structure from input to output as for a function.</p>
<p>Next along the power spectrum is functions, where one has to read code to see
how data structure evolves from input to output. The behavior can be &ldquo;static&rdquo; in
a sense of being &ldquo;shallow&rdquo;, i.e. with loops and recursion avoided. Limiting a
function&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;go deeper&rdquo; can be related to transparency by analogy to
transparency of a physical medium. A block of material that is relatively
&ldquo;clear&rdquo; (an intensive property), but that has great depth (an extensive
property), is less transparent because a signal through it has a long distance
over which to attenuate. &ldquo;If it can&rsquo;t repeat, it&rsquo;s not Turing complete,&rdquo;
yielding a less powerful but more predictable artifact.</p>
<p>Beyond &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; functions is macros, where the specification of dynamic behavior
may itself may be specified dynamically. Examples of macros in Clojure include
those used to facilitate polymorphism and interface protocols.</p>
<p>Many programming environments, by design or idiomatically, bundle one or more of
the shown elements of power rather than allow their use à la carte, making it
difficult to tune transparency. In object-oriented programming (OOP), for
example, an object tends to encapsulate some data, situate itself in some
type/class hierarchy, define static behavior/methods for operating on its data,
define dynamic methods for operating on itself, and dynamically select code to
execute based on type polymorphism and inheritance.</p>
<h2 id="coming-full-circle---making-lisp-worse">Coming Full Circle - Making Lisp &ldquo;Worse&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Richard Gabriel&rsquo;s example of a <em>right-thing</em> language is Common Lisp, and his
example of a <em>worse-is-better</em> language is C.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It seems that
while C has gotten &ldquo;better&rdquo; (object-orientation in C++ and other C-like
languages), Common Lisp has gotten, not &ldquo;worse&rdquo;, but worse-able, via Clojure.</p>

<br><em>The materials science tetrahedron, which illustrates how a material's properties, processing, performance, and structure are interrelated (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=4198116">source</a>).</em>
<br><br>
<p>What <em>is</em> a &ldquo;material&rdquo;? There is no label for it in the diagram above. And what
is the nature of the relationships among properties, processing, performance,
structure, and characterization in the diagram above? From the diagram, each
&ldquo;edge&rdquo; connecting &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; is indistinct &ndash; it seems that everything connects to
everything else in the same way, except for characterization, which is a thing
that just floats in the middle, geometrically equidistant from every node in the
fully connected graph.</p>
<p>In <em>Process and Reality</em>, Whitehead elaborates on an epochal theory of
time<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, for which Hickey produced a useful diagram<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
as part of his work to apply this model to programming language design. I
believe this diagram can be usefully related to that of the materials
paradigm tetrahedron.</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/9f33e07ac392106bccc6206d5d69efe3380c306a/Hickey_Rich/AreWeThereYet.md#user-content-slide-31">
<img src="/img/hickey_are-we-there-yet_epochal-time-model.jpg" width="100%"
alt="Epochal time model, from Rich Hickey's \"Are We There Yet\" talk."></a>
<br><em>Epochal time model, from Rich Hickey's "Are We There Yet" talk (<a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/9f33e07ac392106bccc6206d5d69efe3380c306a/Hickey_Rich/AreWeThereYet.md">transcript</a>).</em>
<br><br>
<p>Consider a given material structure as a <em>value</em>, an unchanging thing, as
opposed to a <em>variable</em>. Consider that this unchanging thing, this
structure-as-value, may be observed/perceived/remembered in a manner that does
not change it, that does not change the structure &ndash; this is characterization.</p>
<p>Now, consider an event that, when it &ldquo;happens&rdquo; to a structure, when it applies
to a structure, results in a different structure, i.e. a different value is
observed after the event &ndash; this is processing. Processing is a function
that takes one value to another value, one structure to another structure.</p>
<p>What, then, is a &ldquo;material&rdquo;? A material is a post hoc composition of structure
values, an identity <em>assigned</em> to a succession of values related by successive
processing events. A structure-as-value is associated with a
material-as-identity, and a value assigned to an identity may be termed a
&ldquo;state&rdquo; of that identity. The conceptually synthesized identity, the material,
&ldquo;has&rdquo; states, and through characterization, through observation/perception, a
state &ldquo;has&rdquo; <em>properties</em>. A property is an output value of a characterization
process that takes a structure as an input value.</p>
<p>What is perceived from a value may be termed a property of the value, and if the
input value is associated with an identity, the perception may be thought of as
a property of a state of the identity, or alternatively as a property of the
identity at a given moment in time, i.e. at a given state. Thus, a &ldquo;material
property&rdquo; is a characterization of one or more distinct structures identified as
a material via an epochal succession of processing events. When a material
&ldquo;changes&rdquo; via processing, its properties may &ldquo;change&rdquo; as well because the
observed properties depend on structures, on values, on &ldquo;states&rdquo; of a
&ldquo;material&rdquo;, not on the post hoc material-as-identity.</p>
<p>In this model, time is not a continuously running clock. Time happens in
discrete steps, epochs, one-to-one with events that represent the processing of
values. A &ldquo;state&rdquo; is a snapshot, a material-as-identity&rsquo;s structure-as-value at
a given &ldquo;moment&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> &ldquo;in time&rdquo;. This state is customarily extended by
idempotent characterization of that structure&rsquo;s properties-as-values.</p>
<p>Finally, what is material performance in terms of the epochal time model? A
material&rsquo;s performance is determined from the characterized properties of that
material&rsquo;s structural state space in a given environmental context of process
control that dictates state transitions. That is, material performance is an
identity assigned to a succession of characterized-properties values that are
sourced in turn from the succession of structures reached by a
materials-as-identity in a processing context. See the diagram below.</p>

implementation of the Clojure programming language, I hope that this model
as mapped to the elements of the materials-paradigm tetrahedron above can
be productively applied to the design and implementation of <a href="/posts/headless-mrms/">materials research

<![CDATA[<p>A sequence diagram can serve as a fat-marker sketch of a happy-path checklist
for a spike.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s unpack that mouthful. First, the <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#fat-marker-sketches">fat-marker
sketch</a> is an
idea well-described in Ryan Singer&rsquo;s book <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook">Shape
Up</a>, based on software design practices at
<a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. It&rsquo;s a way to roughly shape a
two-dimensional layout for a user interface when consideration of those two
spatial dimensions is essential to articulate the intended user
experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding">Breadboarding</a>,
another shaping technique discussed in the book, narrows focus to three design
elements: <em>places</em>, <em>affordances</em>, and <em>connection lines</em>. Each place has
affordances, and connection lines show how affordances take a user from place to
place. Whereas fat-marker sketching addresses spatial concerns,
breadboarding narrows focus to logical concerns only.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">sequence diagram</a> can be
rough like breadboarding, with a focus on connection lines among places, where
the &ldquo;places&rdquo; are participants/actors. The connection lines in such a diagram
are the arrows between lifelines. Consider these arrows as items on a checklist,
so that the arrow labels are checklist-item labels.</p>
<p>A sequence diagram rises to the level of a fat-marker sketch when considering
dimensionality. Fat-marker sketches deal with the two spatial dimensions on a
user&rsquo;s screen. With sequence diagrams, there is one logical dimension &ndash; the
identity of a participant/actor process, which may be physically in the same
&ldquo;place&rdquo; as another participant/actor or not &ndash; and one temporal dimension, that
of <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/9f33e07ac392106bccc6206d5d69efe3380c306a/Hickey_Rich/AreWeThereYet.md#user-content-slide-31">epochal
time</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, a sequence diagram may be read as detailing a single path, e.g. a
&ldquo;happy path&rdquo; for a core use case, through the effective
<a href="https://statecharts.github.io/">statechart</a> of the system as a whole. The
result of building out this whole-system (&ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo;) use case, of <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.2-chapter-11#integrate-one-slice">geting one
integrated slice
done</a>, is known
as a <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?SpikeSolution">spike</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, a sequence diagram can serve as a fat-marker sketch of a happy-path
checklist for a spike, with each labeled arrow corresponding to an item to
implement and check off.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/polyneme/maggtomic/blob/f632832dafc01184beccb225f8b0a600c46bda6e/README.md#sequence-diagrams-for-use-case-happy-paths">Here are a few example sequence
diagrams</a>
that I used to shape up some imagined spikes for a project I&rsquo;m working on now. I

<![CDATA[<p>This is a brief note on my perception of the ISO 11179 Metadata Registry (MDR) standard,
including my perception of its relation to W3C Semantic Web standards. Examples are
taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_11179">this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
<p>In ISO 11179, there are <em>concepts</em>. There are relations of concepts to wider and more narrow concepts.
There are also relations between a concept and one or more <em>representations</em> of the concept
(i.e. different terms/synonyms are used, but the concept is the same).</p>
<p>There are <em>object classes</em>. An example is a &ldquo;person&rdquo;. Combining an object class with a
concept such as &ldquo;income&rdquo; forms a more specific <em>data element concept</em>, e.g. a person&rsquo;s income.
Different representations of a data element concept are <em>data elements</em>. Differences in
these representations may be due to the use of different terms/synonyms, and/or due to
different <em>value domains</em>.</p>
<p>An example of a value domain for the data element concept &ldquo;sex of person&rdquo; is &ldquo;M=Male, F=Female,
U=Unknown&rdquo;. No correctness is implied by selection of a value domain &ndash; it simply is in use or is not in use
by a given data element. {M,F,U} are permitted values for &ldquo;sex of person&rdquo; in a particular data set
where &ldquo;sex of person&rdquo; is the data element concept and e.g. &ldquo;sex of individual where the value domain is {M,F,U}&rdquo;
is a data element for that concept, where the specialized representation in this case comprises both a
synonym term (&ldquo;individual&rdquo; for the object class &ldquo;person&rdquo;) and a value domain. Data sets are many-to-many wrt
data elements.</p>
<h3 id="relation-to-semantic-web-standards">Relation to Semantic Web standards</h3>
<p>A concept seems like a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">skos</a>:Concept entity, which relates
to e.g. skos:broader and skos:narrower concepts. Other SKOS relations can apply, e.g. skos:related,
skos:closeMatch, skos:exactMatch, etc. An object class seems like a
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">rdfs</a>:Class / <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">owl</a>:Class.</p>
<p>A data element concept, an association of an object class with a conceptual characteristic, seems like
e.g.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>IF   { :p a rdf:Property .
       :p rdfs:domain :MyObjectClass ;
          rdfs:range :MyCharacteristicConcept . }
THEN { :p a :MyDataElementConcept . }
</code></pre><p>and thus an rdf:Property can be a bridge for multiple perceived data element concepts. Or, you
can use one property name for each distinct data element concept.</p>
<p>A data element seems like something that can subclass an owl:Restriction entity, extend its rdfs:domain,
or both, e.g.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>:MyDataElement
  a :MyDataElementConcept ;
  rdfs:subClassOf [ a owl:Restriction ;
                    owl:onProperty :p ;
                    owl:allValuesFrom :SomeSet ;
                    rdfs:domain :MySynonymOfObjectClass ] .
</code></pre><p>I haven&rsquo;t seem rdfs:domain used inside a owl:Restriction class, but owl:onProperty is singular and required,
so the semantics of rdfs:domain entailment via an owl:Restriction seems clear to me. There is likely a simpler
way, but this was merely an exercise in mental mapping.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I enjoyed Rich Hickey&rsquo;s talk on deconstructing the database, whereby he shows an unbundling of
the concerns of transaction processing and durable storage from the concerns of a query engine, of
live indexing, and of caching. Rather than have all concerns integrated in one server process for
database management, the transaction processor is a separate service, the transactor, and durable
storage of data segments/blocks is also a separate service with a key-value-store interface. See the
screenshot below, which links to the full one-hour talk.</p>

</a>
<em>Slide of Datomic architecture, from Rich Hickey's talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cym4TZwTCNU" target="_blank">Deconstructing the Database</a>.</em>
<p></p>
<p>The Datomic architecture is well-suited for read-heavy workloads. If all server nodes bundled all database functionality,
then any node could process transactions, and thus scale writes, but then one has to address the complexity of
distributed transactions. In the Datomic model, there is a single transactor, but there may be
several reader processes, each of which has a local cache of the shared durable storage.</p>
<p>The shared durable storage also simplifies things, because although this architecture is not shared-memory,
it also doesn&rsquo;t go as far as shared-nothing. It is more akin to shared-disk, as if all reader nodes
were connected to an attached RAID. Given that this shared storage
is treated as a key-value store, the implementation is flexible: a supercomputing center&rsquo;s shared project filesystem,
AWS S3, Postgres, DynamoDB, whatever.</p>
<p>Key enablers of this architecture are (a) immutability of the data and (b) a simple information model,
that of tuples representing assertions and retractions of simple entity-attribute-value statements, each
with an associated transaction entity (where a key attribute of this entity is a timestamp value). This
means that persistent data structures can be used in merging new data with old data &ndash; lots
of on-disk structure is shared, and with maximal granularity because there are no schema migrations.</p>
<h3 id="relation-to-propagation-networks">Relation to Propagation Networks</h3>
<p>In Alexey Radul&rsquo;s Ph.D. thesis, <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/54635">propagation networks</a> are
detailed as a flexible and expressive substrate for computation. The idea is that a collection of
<em>propagators</em> act on durable memory <em>cells</em> that accumulate information. For example, the figure below
from Radul&rsquo;s thesis depicts a multidirectional temperature converter that embodies the formula
\(T_{C} = (T_{F} - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}\).</p>
<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/54635" target="_blank" style="text-underline:none">
<img style="padding:0.5rem;border:solid lightgray" src="/img/propagation-network-temperature-converter.png" width="100%" alt="A multidirectional temperature converter." />
</a>
<em>A multidirectional temperature converter.</em>
<p></p>
<p>The formula is a relation, not simply a function, and the propagators are relational as well, reading from
attached cells and also writing to them in order to propagate information. In the network above,
the cells are depicted as circles, and there are some propagators &ndash; depicted as squares &ndash; that are
rather simple in that they just output a constant value to any attached cells.</p>
<p>Cells in propagation networks accumulate information, so their semantics as data stores are like the
immutable durable stores of Datomic rather than e.g. the update-in-place B<sup>+</sup>-trees of
many database systems. Thus, I can envision a propagation network architecture where each cell maps
to a pair of (transactor, key-value store) corresponding to a Datomic store, and each propagator maps
to an &ldquo;app server process&rdquo; as depicted in the Datomic architecture slide above, connecting to one
or more Datomic <em>cells</em> and propagating information among them as per its locally-installed
logic.</p>
<h3 id="relation-to-tuple-spaces">Relation to Tuple Spaces</h3>
<p>The tuple space model of parallel programming, as for example embodied by
<a href="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ppls/linda.pdf">Linda</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, is one where a multitude
of processes pull and push to a common pool of information represented as tuples. This model
seems to map well to the Datomic model, particularly when extended to a large space of stores
and processors as in the propagation network vision.</p>
<p>If an additional component identifying the cell
is added to the information model, making each statement a 6-tuple rather than the 5-tuple of datomic
(entity, attribute, value, transaction, and assert-or-retract), all information can be pooled in a
common tuple space. Furthermore, given Datomic&rsquo;s immutability semantics, the complexity of blocking
operations as described in the Linda paper can be traded for that of ensuring
valid-for-this-transaction reads, which is already a first-class concern of Datomic queries.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>What matters for application of knowledge &ndash; what substantiates it? I think two things do:
shared conceptualizations, and use cases.</p>
<p>Shared conceptualizations, or ontologies, materialize entities and their relations with each other
(i.e. object properties) and with data literals / annotations (i.e. data properties).
Applying such a conceptualization to given instances
(and bundling this application with the conceptualization) results in a
graph &ndash; not a system of interlocking tables (i.e. a relational database).</p>
<p>Use cases materialize access patterns. Use cases manifest as user interfaces with affordances for
interpretation of and interaction with the knowledge graph - with the shared conceptualization along
with the known concrete entities and literals to which that ontology is asserted to apply.</p>
<p>Once use cases as prototyped are validated, then the observed shapings of data in service of the access
patterns may themselves be materialized with some confidence. These shapings are your system of interlocking
tables (e.g. SQL), your collections of JSON documents (e.g. MongoDB), etc.</p>
<p>ETL takes you from one shaping of data to another. A knowledge graph has the most
general structure &ndash; the least possible shaping. To develop use cases is to discover shapings. Once you
identify shapings, you can ensure adequate ongoing performance of use cases (i.e. in &ldquo;production&rdquo;)
by implementing ETL from your source graph to appropriate shapings that in turn are exposed by APIs.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A headless content management system (CMS) is one that is API-first, decoupled from any particular
presentation layer on the front-end. Such a service can support multiple channels for
working with and presenting content, given the type of user and their context.
<a href="https://strapi.io">Strapi</a> is one example of an open-source headless CMS.</p>
<p>Consider a so-called materials research management system (MRMS).
I am specializing this to materials science, rather than say a generalized &ldquo;scientific research&rdquo;
management system. Furthermore, I am specializing this to research: not procurement, not product
development, not manufacturing, not distribution, not sales.</p>
<p>However, I am also not drilling further
in to, say, &ldquo;research data&rdquo;. I am including all activities that pertain to research, which may include
reference to, for example, procurement activity. Other concerns of research activity
include domain knowledge/ontologies, hypotheses, experiments, analyses, reports, and presentations.
Finally, I reuse the &ldquo;management system&rdquo; part from prior art like content management systems (CMSes) and
relational database management systems (RDBMSes) that provide useful interfaces for governance.</p>
<p>So, what are some examples of such systems? Citrine Informatics advertises an online
<a href="https://citrine.io/product/what-is-the-citrine-platform/">platform</a> that uses an open-source <a href="https://citrineinformatics.github.io/gemd-docs/">data
model</a>
they developed called Graphical Expression of Materials Data (GEMD). The GEMD model distinguishes materials,
processes, and measurements, and distinguishes between intent (specification) and realization
(e.g. actual conditions observed for a run of an experiment). For example, a process of procurement can
be said to produce a material, another process can prepare a sample of a material as an ingredient for
a measurement run, etc. It is clear that the Citrine platform is intended as a system for
materials research management.</p>
<p>Another example of a MRMS is the Materials Project&rsquo;s contributions framework,
<a href="https://mpcontribs.org/">MPContribs</a>. At this time, MPContribs does not provide many
affordances for explicit modeling of research assets and activities &ndash; unlike GEMD, the semantics
of submissions are mostly implicit and open-ended. The emphasis of MPContribs is empowering users to
submit generic reports and custom presentations of processed research results in a way that links
them to existing Materials Project materials. MPContribs is a great example of a headless MRMS, as it
serves both customized landing pages for each submitted project as well as inset &ldquo;cards&rdquo; on pre-existing
material detail pages.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;d like to point out Toyota Research Institute&rsquo;s
computational autonomy for materials discovery (CAMD) system, an <a href="https://github.com/tri-amdd/camd">open-source</a>
framework that explicitly models and manages research concerns like hypotheses, experiments, and analyses.
One designs sequential learning campaigns to deploy software agents that evaluate
candidate materials in some search space, given relevant seed data, and that iteratively dispatch hypotheses to an
experimental facility (whether a physical laboratory or e.g. a density functional theory (DFT) program). CAMD
is also a type of headless MRMS that tracks hypotheses and experiments as well as provenance regarding
decision processes.</p>
<p>One reason I&rsquo;m particularly interested in <em>headless</em> materials research management systems is that research activities
are distributed, not centralized. Systems that accommodate a variety of contributions from a variety
of stakeholders, particularly across not only space but time (employees move on, graduate students graduate, &hellip;),
can flourish. The World Wide Web (WWW) does this for documents &ndash; HTTP is headless, and web browsers render a variety
of markup for a variety of folks. I&rsquo;m excited about what we can do for data and metadata with HTTP, i.e. the
Semantic Web.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I was asked about a positioning statement for my business, to describe <em>who</em> I work with
and <em>what outcome</em> I help them with: something like &ldquo;Helping X with Y&rdquo;. I gave this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Helping researchers with data discovery, integration, and dissemination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The response I got was &ldquo;Great start. What type of researchers would be an ideal fit?&rdquo; I had thought I
had specialized my audience sufficiently: I&rsquo;m not helping &ldquo;people&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m helping researchers. But I can go
further, not to limit with whom I work, but to focus my marketing effort for the time being. Also,
&ldquo;research&rdquo; is pretty inclusive. There are marketing researchers, investment researchers,
sociology researchers, etc.</p>
<p>An ideal fit for me is materials researchers. I have a lot of experience in this domain, from
small-batch experimental processing and characterization in clean-room environments to
high-throughput simulations and analyses in supercomputing centers. The challenges and applications
excite me, and I like the people.</p>
<p>Okay, so &ldquo;Helping materials researchers with data discovery, integration, and dissemination&rdquo;. That last
part seems like a mouthful. Can I focus again, and pick one of the three as most important for now?
I thought about this, and it was hard to pick one because they seem so related. How so? And can this lead
to a cogent synthesis &ndash; a &ldquo;one thing&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Discovery, integration, and dissemination of data happen in sequence for a given study. There may be some
iterative looping back of course, but you first identify somehow any existing data you can use,
in addition to whatever data you intend to collect deliberately by experiment or simulation. Next, you
must ensure the existing, discovered data is interoperable with your own data and integrate them
for analysis. Finally, you disseminate the data, hopefully as more than just text and figures in an
article.</p>
<p>The degrees of urgency for these stages are distinct in a given study.
Data discovery is of medium urgency &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t really block the later steps. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t take
as much advantage of previous work as you&rsquo;d like to. You&rsquo;d like this to be done well so that it enriches
the quality of the study. However, you don&rsquo;t want it to hold up the rest of the study; it has some urgency,
but you also feel like you can loop back later.</p>
<p>Data integration is of high urgency &ndash; it blocks progress. You get stuck on analysis if you can&rsquo;t
combine the data you need in a suitable way. You can&rsquo;t disseminate results because you can&rsquo;t produce them.</p>
<p>Data dissemination is of low urgency. Was the manuscript accepted? Great.
Gotta get going on the next study. Making the final data easily findable, accessible, interoperable, and
reusable by others is a nice-to-have, but it doesn&rsquo;t block the study. The study&rsquo;s &ldquo;done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: Great data dissemination makes that data discoverable and integrable. An ideal discovery
process is one that facilitates <em>continuous integration</em>. And an ideal integration process is one
that makes the outputs of analyses easy to reuse and by extension to disseminate. Data has a lifecycle,
from discovery, to integration, to dissemination, to re-discovery &ndash; by others in the research community,
by collaborators, or by someone else in your lab &ndash; or you &ndash; six months or more from now.</p>
<p>I help materials researchers with data lifecycle management.
Yes, it needs unpacking, but it&rsquo;s a single, whole outcome, and I hope it makes sense to you.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>The four components of FAIR can be mapped to successive stages of reusability: possible, plausible, probable, and perishable.</p>
<p>The foundational principles of FAIR are Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Ultimately, FAIR is all about reuse, and it&rsquo;s helpful for me to think of the principles as successive stages of
increasing the chance that successful reuse can happen.</p>
<p>Findability is making reuse <em>possible</em>. If no one can discover your data via some open catalog, if even basic metadata is hidden in a silo, then reuse is simply not possible.</p>
<p>Accessibility is making reuse <em>plausible</em>. People and their designated software agents can not only identify relevant resources via metadata, but they can actually retrieve full data for inspection and evaluation. Now, it is plausible that your data may be reused.</p>
<p>Interoperability is making reuse <em>probable</em>. Not only is your data findable and accessible, but there is not too heavy a burden on someone to make your data compatible with their own data and processing tools. Your data is accessible in an open, standard format. You include a schema with the data, preferably in a machine-actionable format as well. Because an interested data consumer needn&rsquo;t do a prohibitive amount of data cleaning/munging, it is significantly more likely that your data may be reused.</p>
<p>Reusability, finally, is making reuse&hellip;<em>perishable</em>. Using a food analogy, let&rsquo;s say you have identified a potential ingredient for a recipe (findability); you know it is in stock at a nearby store (accessibility); and you have determined that it is indeed suitable for use with your kitchen tools, other ingredients you have on-hand for the recipe, etc. (interoperability). Finally, you can bring it home to your kitchen, but you won&rsquo;t necessarily be able to actually use it!</p>
<p>The warranties on and terms of use for data, its licenses, are important, analogous to &ldquo;best by&rdquo; dates, expiration dates, etc. on food. The reusability concern of FAIR does not guarantee reuse, but it again increases the likelihood of reuse because the terms and conditions of reuse are made more explicit and thus a consumer of your data can make a decision to reuse with confidence. Data with no license is like a food product with no expiration date &ndash; does that mean it&rsquo;s forever usable, or will someone likely be unsure and thus choose not to reuse your data?</p>
<p>FAIR is all about reuse. I hope this conceptualization of FAIR via &ldquo;four Ps&rdquo; helps you understand ways you can progressively enhance your data dissemination tactics and thereby enhance your data&rsquo;s discoverability and reuse.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I like Cynthia Arnold&rsquo;s approach to the problem of data discovery for a materials R&amp;D organization.
In a podcast episode for Citrine, she says<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>companies don’t really need to boil the proverbial ocean to make progress in better using the historical data
and the existing data. Doing a data inventory I think is a very good starting point, understanding what you have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An inventory, understanding what you have, is all about <em>finding</em>. Nothing is accessible yet, just identifiable.</p>
<p>She goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then identify which data will provide the most value, and how it will be used once you can organize it and make it
accessible. And this becomes the basis of a data strategy and a data roadmap within the organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is backtracking a FAIR<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> pipeline. Envision some data&rsquo;s end value,
which depends on its successful use (reusable), which depends on its organization for purpose (interoperable),
which depends on it being accessed (accessible).</p>
<p>The focus here is on pursuing a vertical slice of &ldquo;AIR&rdquo;. The &ldquo;F&rdquo; in this FAIR strategy, a data inventory, is wide.
You can think of the outcome of data inventory
as a store of metadata, a virtual data lake, that points to data in existing stores but does not move the data. As
Mark Watson says<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is common to build a large data lake and then have staff not be able to find data.
Don’t try to do everything at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back to Arnold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start with where you have problems and opportunities, and ask what data can support being better to deliver
on these solutions and these opportunities. When the rubber hits the road, you can put together a focused team
of a few content experts and some systems people. They can work together to help clean up and organize and put
the identified datasets to use on real opportunities rather quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work of a few &ndash; not many &ndash; content experts and systems people will result in accessed data being made
interoperable with the requirements of the present opportunity. Avoid having too many stakeholders on early prototypes.
Conceptual integrity is key.</p>
<p>Arnold finishes up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then, I think if you’re systematic about this and proceed down the line with fulfilling your data strategy
really directed at real opportunities and problem solutions, I think you’re going to find you’re going to build
your way into a good data taxonomy and framework that will be highly reusable and valuable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, as vertical slices of &ldquo;AIR&rdquo; accumulate around the nexus of your wide-&ldquo;F&rdquo; data inventory, latent
opportunities for connectivity will surface, unifying your graph of accessible, interoperable, and reusable data.
Embrace eventual connectivity.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Excel is known to, by default, convert gene names to dates and floating-point numbers. A gene symbol like SEP2 will become &lsquo;2-Sep&rsquo;, and an accession ID like &lsquo;2310009E13&rsquo; will becomes &lsquo;2.31E+13&rsquo;. A comment article in Genome Biology found errors like this for approximately 20% of papers in leading genomics journals with supplementary Excel files.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> For Excel, &ldquo;there is no way to turn this off.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Type inference is helpful technology. However, it works best when it is &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, &ldquo;late-binding&rdquo;. If you enter a value that might be a date and then later try to apply a function that requires a date as input, for example to extract the year or month, <em>then</em> it is quite helpful for the system to assign a date type to the value. If another function call is attempted that requires another type as input, such as a text string or a number, then that is a problem, and the system should report the inconsistency.</p>
<p>With good wait-and-see type inference, one needn&rsquo;t define a value&rsquo;s type up front. However, eager systems like Excel leave one with no choice but to, for example, preformat cells as Text before entering data. This is like having to declare all of your variables&rsquo; types up front in a program &ndash; a lot of people would rather not, and that gets us all into trouble when systems like Excel try to help before it&rsquo;s clear what help is appropriate in a given context.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>For the Jewish holiday of Passover, guidance is provided as to how to explain its interface
when onboarding various identified end users. In particular, four types of children are identified.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;wise&rdquo; child asks about features and how to accomplish tasks in the ideal manner.
They accept the interface as appropriate for them, taking for granted that it is well-designed &ndash; they
need only learn what to do. Use of convention and curt tooltips may be good enough.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; child asks, &ldquo;What is this service of <em>yours</em>?!&rdquo; They understand the intention
of the service/interface, like the &ldquo;wise&rdquo; child, but they do not accept <em>your</em> offering.
They require some convincing. An elaboration of benefits and trade-offs relative to alternatives could help
&ndash; perhaps even a light manifesto is warranted.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;simple&rdquo; child asks, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; They require more introduction to the origins of the service,
intended use cases, etc. A FAQ may suffice.</p>
<p>The fourth child &ldquo;knows not how to ask&rdquo;. They require some proactive hand-holding &ndash; a tour, guides, tutorials.</p>
<p>These children may be different individuals, but they may also be &ldquo;inner&rdquo; children contained within each individual,
either all at once or appearing at different times given task-relevant contexts (&ldquo;I contain multitudes&rdquo;).
How do you address the multitudes of/within users for your interfaces? Is it helpful to identify the four
children among your target audience?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Data-driven programming means that you change the logic of a program
by changing data rather than code.</p>
<p>A good example is <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch09s01.html#bayes_spam">statistical spam filtering</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
The conventional approach is to continually update and maintain code that describes
relevant patterns to match and that implements conditional logic based on
elaborate pattern-matching. Statistical filters, on the other hand, use classification data obtained from email users
in order to assign weights to certain words and phrases, which are in turn fed to
the filtering algorithm.</p>
<p>Raymond notes that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>experience with statistical filters seems to show that the particular learning algorithm
used is
far less important than the quality of the spam and nonspam data sets from which the learning algorithm computes its
weights. So the results of statistical filters really are driven more by the shape of the data than by the
algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentiment is echoed by Halevy, Norvig, and Pereira for language models for speech recognition and translation
:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;invariably, simple models and a lot of data trump more  elaborate models based on less data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A popular alternative web-page path router for React applications, the Reach Router,
<a href="https://reach.tech/router/ranking">dynamically assigns</a> each registered path a
score in order to find the best match, rather than adhering
to some hard-coded control flow, as is conventional for such routers.</p>
<p>Aleph, a toolkit for data search, management and analysis in investigative reporting, ingests files
in a data-driven way:<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the ingestors then kind of branch out, and, basically what they&rsquo;re doing is they&rsquo;re
<a href="https://github.com/alephdata/aleph/blob/aa447e62430a9ff594304dabb3ab223dbd1daba9/services/ingest-file/ingestors/manager.py#L89">auctioning</a>
off the files, saying &lsquo;hey, I&rsquo;ve got a file, and its filename extension is so-and-so, and this is, like, the first
five
bytes, who wants to parse it?&rsquo; And then all the different parsers kind of go and say &lsquo;hey, I can do that.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that data-driven programming can be a useful approach for user interfaces across large, growing sets of
heterogeneous data. Conventionally, when data is added, different forms of presentation are hard-coded to replace
old forms in order to better accommodate qualitatively more data, new data types, etc. Instead, what if
presentation components dynamically populated an interface based on the accessible data and its underlying ontology?</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Word games are a technique for troubleshooting problem statements. They are usually cheaper than unwanted solutions.
They expose ways that well-intentioned problem solvers trip over a misunderstood word, a misplaced comma, or
ambiguous syntax.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the dictionary game, you make a list of a dictionary&rsquo;s meanings for each word in the original sentence. Then, you
try to apply each of those meanings in turn. Consider a little word like <em>had</em>. It&rsquo;s defined as the past tense and past
participle of <em>have</em>, which in turn has tens of definitions. Consider the phrase, &ldquo;Mary had a little lamb.&rdquo; The
dictionary game asks you to consider options for <em>had</em> (via <em>have</em>) such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be in possession of, as one&rsquo;s property; own.</li>
<li>To be related or in a particular relationship to: <em><strong>have three children</strong></em>.</li>
<li>To hold in one&rsquo;s mind; entertain: <em><strong>have doubts</strong></em>.</li>
<li>To bribe or buy off.</li>
<li>To win a victory over; to down.</li>
<li>To cheat, deceive, or trick.</li>
<li>To accept or take: <em><strong>I&rsquo;ll have the gray jacket</strong></em>.</li>
<li>To partake of; consume, as by eating or drinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider playing the dictionary game with problem statements involving your data: statements and queries
involving names of tables/collections, columns/fields, etc.</p>
<p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) approach to data modeling leans into the dictionary game. A resource never
has a string literal like &ldquo;title&rdquo; as a property. Rather, it has a
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/vcard-rdf/#vcard:title">v:title</a> (job title of an employee), a

<![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;ve collected a sample of important questions that you want a data system to answer.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
How do you ensure the system will be able to answer those particular questions?
You might have the questions &ldquo;in mind&rdquo; as you design and develop a data model, process recorded observations to fit
that model, write queries against that model, and process query results into readable answers. However, it may take
considerable effort to translate both your questions into queries and query results into answers.</p>
<p>You can save effort by practicing wishful thinking. Imagine a query language that supports low-effort expression of your
questions and low-effort interpretation of query results. Express your queries in that language. The terms and
constructs you use in your query expressions will naturally guide the development of the rest of the system. You can
choose your own adventure with query languages: from off-the-shelf options such as SQL and MongoDB, to bespoke
domain-specific languages, both programmatic (e.g., APIs and client libraries) and visual (e.g., browser-based apps).</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I decided to build on my
<a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-20-queries-heuristic/">&ldquo;20 queries&rdquo; exercise</a> and
draft a partial ontology for materials using Protégé, an open-source ontology editor.
I&rsquo;ll focus discussion here on named restriction classes for materials. For example: what
materials belong to the Zintl phase?</p>
<p>Below is a view in Protégé<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> detailing the <code>:ZintlPhase</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> class:</p>
<p><img src="/img/protege-zintylphase.png" width="100%"
alt="Details for Zyntl phase class in Protégé UI" /></p>
<p>I annotated the URI for the ZyntlPhase class with a readable <code>rdfs:label</code> value, so
Protégé displays this instead. I also annotated the class with a <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> value pointing
to a Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>Rather than pinned merely as a so-called
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; class in a pre-defined hierarchy, the ZintlPhase class is defined
as equivalent to a class that satisfies certain restrictions. This is a bit more powerful
than defining an anonymous class and then giving it a name, because in the latter case you still
need to produce instances of your named class through its constructor.</p>
<p>With an
ontology such as this, you can run a reasoner over your data and infer not only
what restrictions must apply to instances annotated as belonging to a class, but also
infer class membership by noting satisfaction of necessary and sufficient conditions. In this
case, the material mp-1903, containing aluminum and barium, has been inferred
(yellow highlighting) to be an instance of ZintlPhase.</p>
<p>One notable aspect of OWL ontologies highlighted by this example is their Open World Assumption.
The <code>some</code> keyword shown in the screenshot above sets an
existential restriction<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. A Zintl phase material must have an element that
is a metalloid or a post-transition metal. It also must have an element that is an alkali metal
or an alkaline earth metal.</p>
<p>If I had not included the value restriction on a separate property,
that the number of
elements <code>nelements</code> is 2, and
instead tried a cardinality restriction of 2 on the &lsquo;has element&rsquo; property, the reasoner
would not infer any materials as  Zintl phases. This is because of the Open World Assumption:
just because the data for a material includes only two &lsquo;has element&rsquo; assertions, perhaps there
is another assertion not in the current data set that will eventually make its way to us.
Of course there are ways to &ldquo;close&rdquo; things &ndash; including the use of so-called <em>closure axioms</em> &ndash;
but &ldquo;open by default&rdquo; is the OWL way and is attractive for data interoperability.</p>
<p>The ontology also defines an &rsquo;experimentally verified material&rsquo; equivalent class that lays
bare the logic behind inference of what might otherwise be a denormalized key-value pair
associated with a material. The equivalence is a Material with <code>some</code> Structure that
is experimentally verified. In turn, an &rsquo;experimentally verified structure&rsquo; is a Structure
with <code>some</code> experimental provenance. Finally, &rsquo;experimental provenance&rsquo; is a primitive
subclass of Provenance (notice how it has no white stripes in the screenshot).</p>
<p>URIs are given for ICSD IDs, and some of these resources
are instances of &rsquo;experimental provenance&rsquo; (some ICSD IDs are for theoretical studies).
Material mp-1903 has a structure that in turn has some experimental provenance (three matching experimental ICSD IDs
), so it is inferred<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> to be an instance of &rsquo;experimentally verified material&rsquo;
in Protégé.</p>
<p>I have merely explored some ideas about a materials data ontology based on my
&ldquo;20 queries&rdquo; exercise.
This demo ontology is by no means complete or even recommended as a basis, but I hope it&rsquo;s
helpful to illustrate some options for modeling in RDF and OWL via Protégé. Here is
<a href="/ontologies/2020/6/mp">the demo ontology in full</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Homology deals with substructure similarity. For example, the structures of concern may be gene sequences &ndash; structures
with clear reification as physical arrangements of atoms. An example technique for evaluating such structural homology
among genes is k-mer search.</p>
<p>Let <em>structural homology</em> refer here to homology over concrete structures, and let <em>relational homology</em> refer to
homology over abstract relationships that connect concrete structures. This distinction is akin to that between the
analysis of specialized data structures versus graph data.</p>
<p>Data structures and algorithms are intimately linked. Specialized data structures afford associated algorithms for
specialized analysis. Graphs, as data structures that may encode abstract relations and thus must be traversed,
will be slower to analyze than more concrete data structures designed to perform particular operations efficiently.</p>
<p>Consider program interpretation versus compilation. The code-as-data is operated upon similarly in both cases. With
code execution via an interpreter, a rich dynamism is possible for parsing code and data structure on the fly. With
a compiler, guarantees on program and data structure allow the interpretation to be done just once,
and with greater scrutiny for optimization opportunities.</p>
<p>People routinely conceptualize using graphs. Drawing nodes and edges on a whiteboard is a common technique for
thinking about processes, and the resources upon which processes act. Great swaths of mathematics have been
unified under category theory&rsquo;s objects (nodes) and arrows (edges).</p>
<p>Of course, people also routinely need to concretize their abstract conceptualizations. Better
user experiences can follow from translation of graphs into more specialized data structures and associated
algorithms, for efficiency both of machine execution and of human mental modeling (and thus of formulation of
interface-affordant queries).</p>
<p>When designing interfaces to aid a user in identifying similarities among data in a large collection, it is tempting
to focus only on structural homology, in guiding users to probe known unknowns. Apart from searching for homologous
data structures, users may also benefit from searching for homologous metadata structures &ndash; a search for relational
homology, a probing of unknown unknowns. Specialized lexical search, like k-mer search, certainly has its place in a
multiscale model of search across domain-specific data &ndash; but so does semantic search.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>A scientific database cannot be everything to everyone. Jim Gray came up with the
&ldquo;20 queries&rdquo; heuristic. What are the 20 most important questions the researchers want
the data system to answer?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Five questions are not enough to see a broader pattern, and
100 questions would dilute focus.
Also, the relative information in queries ranked by importance is likely to be
logarithmic &ndash; a &ldquo;long tail&rdquo; distribution.
Thus, you&rsquo;re not likely to get five times more information collecting 100 versus 20 queries.</p>
<p>The goal of this step in a design process is to bridge the semantic gap between the
vocabulary used in the
scientific domain and the schema of the database, and to help domain scientists and
database engineers discuss design trade-offs that result in performance trade-offs.</p>
<h2 id="example-exercise">Example Exercise</h2>
<p>I went through this exercise for an existing database, that of the Materials Project (MP).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
MP has a discussion forum<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, which has been active for a few years.
Tens of threads have over a thousand views each. I went through the threads,
sorted by descending view count, to pick out 20 queries posed.</p>
<p>Obviously, many of the found queries are residual queries,
that is, queries that post authors were not able
to answer clearly using MP&rsquo;s existing interface. However, some of the queries were
straightforward to answer via the existing system, as evidenced by replies to those posts.
In either case,
the queries I picked are a collection both sought by users of the system and viewed by many other
active or potential users.</p>
<p>I focused on queries not about the methodology of data collection, but about obtaining
data, including metadata pertaining to understood methodology, e.g. parameter values supplied
to programmatic methods.</p>
<p>I collected approximately 20 queries &ndash; I stopped myself at 24.
Some I formatted as questions, other as stated desires/intentions.
I then tried to identify clusters and thus intended query patterns.
I identified six clusters<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>,
and I removed one query as a duplicate of another.
Here are my results:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>labels/comments to discover what properties are available and what they mean</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the stability of this material with respect to decomposition?</li>
<li>I want magnetic properties of materials (e.g. total_magnetization).</li>
<li>I want to compare elasticity, like shear or bulk modulus, to
density, to make a plot, so in excel form.</li>
<li>What are the meanings of the components of Structures? Like what is a &ldquo;matrix&rdquo;?</li>
<li>Which structures have been experimentally verified?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>named restriction classes of materials</p>
<ul>
<li>What materials belong to the Zintl phase?</li>
<li>What are the formation energies of sulfides, fluorides, and oxides?</li>
<li>I want perovskite material data.</li>
<li>What is the structure-property metadata for the 941 piezoelectric
materials in de Jong et al.&rsquo;s 2015 paper?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>entity types different than materials but related in applications</p>
<ul>
<li>I want data on batteries that contain a material by ID, or by chemical composition.</li>
<li>I want XYZ files for a bunch of Li-ion battery electrolyte molecules.</li>
<li>I want the INCAR file that was used to optimize a structure (from the blessed Task).</li>
<li>What is the KPOINTS file used for the bandstructure calculation of GaP (mp-2490)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>data to a spreadsheet (tsv,csv) format</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I get basic information about Li-containing compounds
above the hull, to a spreadsheet?</li>
<li>I want results sorted by increasing stability (decreasing e_above_hull).</li>
<li>How do I download a few properties, like density and energy, for all compounds,
for input to machine learning?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>complex literal types</p>
<ul>
<li>I am looking for XRD patterns of Co-Pd compounds.</li>
<li>I want dielectric tensor data.</li>
<li>What are CIF files for the different polymorphs of formula X?</li>
<li>What is the CIF for VO2 of space group P21/C?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>queries involving multiple values for a property/attribute</p>
<ul>
<li>What materials have a band gap between 0.5 and 1.2 eV?</li>
<li>What materials are in the chemical system of Ge, Se, and O (so
including binaries and pure elements)?</li>
<li>I want formation energies, etc. for materials with both Ti and O and nothing else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is only one step in a design process,
but I hope this example helps you better understand the &ldquo;20 queries&rdquo; heuristic
and how you might apply
it to your work in designing data systems appropriate for domain specialists.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>What makes data reliable? A recent article<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> outlines five properties. It&rsquo;s</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;clean&rdquo; &ndash; formatted uniformly, conforming to certain rules/schema, etc.</li>
<li>grounded in shared meaning spaces &ndash; names are unambiguous</li>
<li>supplied with context &ndash; where it comes from, how it was sourced</li>
<li>accessible in a standardized format &ndash; easily imported</li>
<li>maintained &ndash; kept up-to-date</li>
</ol>
<p>In
<a href="http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/content/what-knowledge-graph">&ldquo;What is a Knowledge Graph?&rdquo;</a>,
a vocabulary is presented that maps to the first four properties of reliable data above:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <em>graph</em> is a set of assertions expressed between entities. Meaning is encoded via
graph structure. Cleanliness comes in part from limiting the set of relations (edges)
under consideration for an analysis.</li>
<li>An <em>unambiguous graph</em> has these relations and entities unambiguously identified &ndash;
grounded in ontologies as shared meaning spaces.</li>
<li>A <em>bare statement</em> graph is one that does not also encode provenance,
especially justification and attribution, in the graph.</li>
<li>Use of Semantic Web standards like RDF ensure open serialization formats and query tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <em>knowledge graph</em> is then presented as an unambiguous graph, with a limited set of relations,
that encodes provenance &ndash; and is thus not simply a &ldquo;bare statement&rdquo; graph.</p>
<p>The way that a knowledge graph encodes provenance is important for the fifth property of reliable
data above &ndash; maintainability. One part of maintenance is about adding new facts, and another
part is about managing changes to models to keep analyses reproducible.</p>
<p>Knowledge graphs are self-describing, <em>self-revealing</em> (aka &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo;).
They represent facts (data) and models (metadata) in the same, machine-readable way. An ontology is
a blueprint for your actuals in the graph, that you ship with the graph.
Add a schema graph (ontology) to an instance graph (data), and you get a
knowledge graph.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>If you ensure that even tiny graphs<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> include not only their instance data but also
(linked identifiers for) their associated provenance, then maintenance becomes a simple
additive process, perhaps with a process akin to periodic log-structured merges for compaction.</p>
<p>Assertions become not-current quickly. By shipping provenance <em>with</em> the data and
not merely <em>alongside</em> it, you can ensure data reliability in-process at the query level.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Organizational capabilities can be divided into
three categories: resources, processes, and priorities.
Resources are <em>what</em> you use to achieve an outcome,
processes are <em>how</em> you achieve it, and priorities are <em>why</em>.
Understanding capabilities in this way can aid in strategy
not only across
a large organization but also within units, and even for individuals.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Resources are tangible assets. Resources that you use and consult as part of intended
processes, and to communicate intended priorities, are neither the processes
nor the priorities themselves.</p>
<p>If you outsource all or part of a process,
you erode in-house process capability.
You still get secondary output resources from primary input resources via these
outsourced processes, and
downstream in-house processes are unaffected. You might eventually find yourself
sailing as Theseus &ndash; you continue to have and produce the resources you
need, so it&rsquo;s still the same ship, right?</p>
<p>As part of a deliberate short-term strategy, it can be a good idea to outsource
a process,
or, equivalently, a component of it. Your plan has been
validated, and you&rsquo;re focused on growth. However, if you don&rsquo;t know enough
to set a deliberate strategy, then yours may be an emergent strategy, impatient
on validation and patient on growth. Validation is about checking assumptions
as part of any prediction or forecasting: what must be true for this to work?
It might not be a good idea to outsource processes key to validating an
emergent strategy.</p>
<p>For data-intensive research,
commercial informatics platforms can mitigate the
need to develop or maintain in-house process capabilities,
for which ongoing professional
development/training is crucial. However, this means that the manner in which you
derive insight from internal data resources may be intimately tied to the
capabilities &ndash; the resources, processes, and priorities &ndash; of another organization.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>How do you source data relevant for some analysis? Once you &ldquo;have&rdquo; the data, how do you feed it to the analytic task?</p>
<p>Traditional <em>enterprise data integration</em> joins paths across a handful of silos
for a handful of specific analytic tasks.
In data science, however, neither the set of relevant silos nor the set of relevant analytic tasks are both small and
well-defined.</p>
<p>Just as business enterprises sanction siloing for business units, academic research groups sanction siloing
for their members. Lab members can certainly collaborate, but each graduate student and postdoc typically is
granted operational agility sufficient to distinguish themselves as a research unit with their own output, such as

operational agility, will allow individual business units to &ldquo;do their own thing.&rdquo; This leads to data silos,
one for each unit. Common analytic tasks that motivate joins across silos include:
negotiating with suppliers, where data sourced from each unit&rsquo;s procurement systems can help suggest
terms and conditions for new vendor contracts; and classifying spending, where taxonomies for parts and
transactions can help reconcile overall strategy with resource allocation.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Data Integration: The Current Status and the Way Forward,&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Stonebraker and Ilyas discuss how to support the work of data scientists within enterprises.
Given the rise of data-intensive science<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>,
their discussion pertains to many research groups as well.</p>
<p>Data discovery is the use of relationships across silo metadata to source data relevant for some set
of analytics tasks. These relationships can be in some cases automatically discovered,
which is valuable when silos don&rsquo;t explicitly include such relationship metadata.</p>
<p>Join-paths, across relationships, are how data are feed to specific analytic tasks. Join-paths can also in
some cases be automatically discovered,
which is valuable when potential analytics tasks are numerous or not pre-defined.</p>
<p>You have local access to structured databases, to directories of individual files, and you&rsquo;d like to access
public data sources as well. You also have a battery of analytic tasks, many of which might have known schemas
for inputting data. The nature and number of these data sources and analytic tasks change over time.
Data discovery and join-path discovery are key ideas to achieve high-quality results
in this kind of environment within hours or days rather than weeks or months.</p>
<p>Stonebraker and Ilyas mention use of &ldquo;semantic features of the various tables and columns&rdquo; and of
&ldquo;semantically coherent join paths,&rdquo; with references to recent academic projects.
Semantic Web technologies such as RDF graphs and ontology-aware SPARQL engines are well-suited to help tackle
these discovery problems.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I was reminded of the importance of approachable, low-barrier-to-entry tools for data management by
Monica Granados and Lily Zhao in their presentation of the Frictionless Data toolkit.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>They showcased use of a browser-based interface<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> for a simple yet valuable task: associating title and
description metadata with potentially cryptic column header names in a CSV file, and exporting that
metadata together with the raw data to an open-source package format.</p>
<p>First, they directed the app to load an <code>Algae.csv</code> CSV file from an open data archive.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The app
detected tabular data and offered to infer field names and data types:</p>
<p><img src="/img/create-frictionlessdata-io-inferred.png" width="100%"
alt="Field names and data types for a tabular data inferred from a CSV file." /></p>
<p>Next, they showed how a user could fill in field title and description metadata by hand, and
select correct data types from a drop-down list:</p>
<p><img src="/img/create-frictionlessdata-io-filled.png" width="100%"
alt="Field title and description metadata filled in by hand, and data types corrected." /></p>
<p>This kind of interface, where you are guided to fill in metadata and can produce shareable artifacts
that are much more likely to be interpretable both by other humans and machines, is crucial for
science that is more reproducible/trustable, and thus citable.</p>
<p>When I saw this demo, I immediately thought of the potential for linked open data to get this kind of
interface even closer to the Frictionless ideal. The <code>Title</code> and <code>Description</code> fields are analogous to
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label"><code>rdfs:label</code></a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment"><code>rdfs:comment</code></a> fields ubiquitous in linked open
data sets such as Wikidata, and there is
a rich vocabulary of data types as URIs under the namespace typically prefixed as
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"><code>xsd:</code></a>.</p>
<p>If user
input to <code>Title</code> and <code>Description</code> were to be fuzzy-matched to corresponding linked-data field values,
the app could auto-suggest additional metadata for the tabular data column. Unambiguous
URIs from Wikidata or other sources could be associated as metadata, making it even more likely
that the recipient of a data package could understand the semantics of the data &ndash; by following links.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Laws are rules that a particular community recognizes
as regulating the actions of its members. From this definition, Serena Peruzzo
detailed how she sought to use tools from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
&ldquo;find a representation of the rules that makes them more accessible and understandable.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One proposed use case is to identify and highlight ambiguities. NLP of laws as written could help feed back
to lawmakers what parts may be confusing, where a benchmark for &ldquo;confusing&rdquo; could map to a
specific natural language model used by a specific dependency parser; for example,
Peruzzo used the default English model of the spaCy library&rsquo;s parser for her study.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Challenges for such a use case include syntactic complexity &ndash; convoluted sentences &ndash; and
domain specificity.  This reminds me of linting for writing computer-program text.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
Many programming communities recognize certain rules as regulating the actions of their members
with regard to formatting their program text to better facilitate collaboration. Such &ldquo;style guides&rdquo;
are written in natural language for humans to read, but they are also accessible in representations
that allow tools to identify and highlight specific suggestions for a programmer within their
text editor.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Programmers are &ldquo;lawmakers&rdquo; in a way &ndash; their programs pertain to control flow conditional on
situational contexts such as program state and data values. A programmer who reads another&rsquo;s code may find
certain sections ambiguous, meaning they find it difficult to predict the program behavior, and they need to
refer to other sections of the code &ndash; perhaps unit tests! &ndash; to gain confidence in their mental model of the
program&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>Scientific publication also involves a kind of &ldquo;lawmaking&rdquo; in the proposing of novel and useful
constructs for the governance of reason. A manuscript author may offer equations that
pertain to observed behavior, or offer guidelines for interpreting specific results using specific
assumptions. One possibility that excites me is mapping parsed graph representations
(like that produced by spaCy&rsquo;s dependency parser) to candidate linked data resources. Then, inference
could help perform &ldquo;ontology linting&rdquo; that nudges scientists to discover and reuse open,
domain-specific vocabularies that in turn would enhance the discoverability of their associated ideas.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>In an episode of the CoRecursive podcast<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Sam Ritchie uses the phrase
&ldquo;portal abstraction&rdquo; to describe how the use of a particular term can open
a portal &ndash; a gateway &ndash; to a world of relevant prior art.</p>
<p>He discusses issues in analytics. One issue is distributing
summative calculations over data both as batches and in real-time, specialized
for &ldquo;big&rdquo; and &ldquo;fast&rdquo; data, respectively. A second, compounding issue is dealing
with data that may be missing.
The term that helped Sam deal with the first issue is the <em>semigroup</em>
from abstract algebra.
The term that helped him deal with the second issue is the <em>monoid</em>.</p>
<p>Suppose Sam had stuck with a bespoke term like &ldquo;Addable&rdquo; to define a code interface
to objects that could be added together associatively by calling a required &ldquo;add&rdquo;
method of the objects, and that perhaps knew about a special &ldquo;identity&rdquo; value 0
that could represent missing data without affecting the outcome of a sum.
The term &ldquo;Addable&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t specialized enough to yield a treasure trove of related
terms and relevant prior art that would unambiguously apply to the use and
extension of Sam&rsquo;s bespoke interface.</p>
<p>Transitioning to less ambiguous terms like <em>semigroup</em> and <em>monoid</em> led Sam to
read research papers of certain relevance and to discovering useful ideas for his
work, ideas like probabilistic data structures and the hyperloglog algorithm.</p>
<p>In natural language, terms are often overloaded &ndash; words have many meanings. The
vocabulary of abstract algebra has many terms that have no significant competing
meanings among English speakers, and so they indeed are fertile candidates for
portal abstraction. More generally, though, disambiguation among word and phrase
meanings would be needed for similar power.</p>
<p>Linked data use unambiguous URIs to denote terms. Collections of such terms
and their relations, also constructed and machine-readable as linked data,
constitute the variety of ontologies offered by domain specialists. Linked data
is an ecosystem of portal abstractions.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>As part of her introduction to ontology enginering,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Prof. Maria Keet has a slide depicting ontology as a layer apart from conceptual data models:</p>
<div style="margin: 2em 1em">
<img src="/img/ontology-as-layer-atop.png" width="100%"
     alt="Conceptual data models vs. ontologies." />
<em>Conceptual data models vs. ontologies.</em>
<a href="https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~mkeet/OEbook/slides/L1IntroOE19.pdf">[source]</a>
</div>
<p>I like this visualization of various project-specific conceptual models and their associated implementations in
databases and codebases. This highlights the problem of disconnected conceptual models that require recurring
human-human communication to reconcile and facilitate data/model reuse.</p>
<p>Ontologies are a technique to better facilitate such reuse. They make (dis-)agreement among people more explicit than
is possible through informal conceptual models, thereby better representing the knowledge of a subject domain.
Practically, they improve computer-computer, computer-human, and human-human communication.</p>
<p>An ontology uses logic, through terminology and assertions, to structure and constrain meaning.
A quality ontology can represent all that you want to represent &ndash; your intended models &ndash; and not much more.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
It is a formal commitment to a conceptualization that is amenable to automation, especially automated reasoning.</p>
<p>Contrast the ontology-layer approach to conceptual-model integration with an implementation-layer approach. An example
of this latter approach with which I&rsquo;m familiar is that of the <a href="https://materialsproject.org/">Materials Project (MP)</a>,
which uses
key Python codebases to facilitate reuse of project-specific conceptual models. Over several years, any research
effort under the purview of MP has needed to include among its outputs at least one artifact in the
<a href="https://pymatgen.org/">pymatgen</a> codebase &ndash; e.g., a new class/module &ndash; in addition to more traditional artifacts
like publications. This addition to pymatgen (hopefully) connects to previous and future conceptual models via
reuse of existing models-in-code such as pymatgen&rsquo;s <code>Structure</code> and <code>PhaseDiagram</code> classes.</p>
<p>Implementation-layer connection of conceptual models can work as long as all relevant stakeholders use the codebase
and contribute/update implementations. This same strategy is used again within MP for reuse of computational workflows
with the <a href="https://atomate.org/">atomate</a> codebase (which builds atop pymatgen). But this only works at the application
layer. A materials scientist working in a language other than Python, or even in another Python codebase such as
<a href="http://www.aiida.net/">AiiDA</a> &ndash; an alternative to atomate for computational science workflows &ndash; cannot
directly reason about an atomate workflow&rsquo;s conceptual model. The only place that model is formalized is in lines
of atomate code, in an implementation that may need to be run (with dependencies properly installed) to be understood.</p>
<p>Ontologies help to organize and integrate knowledge. They deal with classes and their relationships and constraints in
ways compatible with, but also more powerful than, classical object-oriented programming. They are building blocks for
reuse, without being hard-coded.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s a Python library called <code>monty</code> that supports a convention
for moving between JSON objects and Python class instances.
The major components are a mix-in class, <code>MSONable</code>, along with subclasses of
<code>json.encoder.JSONEncoder</code> and <code>json.decoder.JSONDecoder</code>.</p>
<p>An appropriate JSON object will have two special keys: <code>@module</code> and <code>@class</code>.
The string values of these are used in Python to essentially run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">@module</span> <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">@class</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This isn&rsquo;t how it&rsquo;s actually done &ndash; the syntax alone is wrong &ndash; but the idea is that
the <code>@module</code> and <code>@class</code> fields in the JSON object
are used to import the Python class needed
to instantiate an appropriate object. The rest of the key-value pairs in the source
JSON object are passed as keyword arguments to the class constructor, thus creating a
Python object corresponding to the source JSON.</p>
<p>This instantiation is done recursively for all field
values in the source JSON,
so the procedure can work even for Python classes that take parameters with
non-built-in types.</p>
<p>In this convention, hints for how to interpret the data are passed as data.
There is no separate &ldquo;metadata&rdquo; file that an application needs to
know about and process. An application can be passed an anonynous JSON object and
infer what it means. The decoding is driven by the data.</p>
<h2 id="rdf-and-data-driven-decoding">RDF and data-driven decoding</h2>
<p>RDF-based applications use special keys analogous to the
MSON format&rsquo;s <code>@module</code> and <code>@class</code>. With RDF, though, the keys are
unambiguous identifiers (URIs) and typically build on vocabulary standards
such as RDFS Schema and OWL ontonologies.</p>
<p>In RDF, one could use the key <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type"><code>rdf:type</code></a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
&ndash; or another key that is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subPropertyOf"><code>rdfs:subPropertyOf</code></a> <code>rdf:type</code> &ndash; to
supply a URI
value that
represents a Python class.
Because the identity of the class is unambiguous,
an application might offer to <code>pip install</code> it if applicable.</p>
<p>Finally, because RDF is a set of statements &ndash;
3-tuple (aka
<em>triple</em>) forms of (subject, predicate, object), an RDF subject<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> can have multiple objects given for the
same predicate. Thus, one can associate a subject with multiple classes, each a
valid alternative in the right context. The same set of statements could drive a <code>matplotlib</code> plot in a Jupyter
notebook or a React component in a browser dashboard, without needing to
<a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">hard-code</a> such interoperability for defined use cases.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<p><code>rdf:</code> is a common prefix for <code>&lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;</code>, and tooling for prefixed

a much greater volume of data &ndash; the rest of the iceberg.</p>
<p>The iceberg tip might also be a website with interfaces to explore some data, with links to
API documentation or database dumps for users to obtain the greater volume.</p>
<p>But is this great volume usable to your audience? Can they leverage your data for follow-up studies
that result in citations? Include yourself, your lab, your collaborators, in this audience. Can you reuse

<![CDATA[<p>An effective data unification system is like having an ATM network for your data.</p>
<p>Instead of having to get to a branch
(and only during open hours), wait in line, and talk to a teller, even for simple withdrawals and balance inquiries,
with an ATM you can do many common operations on-demand and quickly.</p>
<p>Similarly, instead of having to identify a data
source, get to the tools for querying it, perhaps waiting for pre-processing/updates, and often needing to talk to a
data teller (engineer/administrator/analyst),
with effective data unification you can answer common (whatever you define as common)
questions on-demand and quickly.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I was fascinated as I skimmed over a publication detailing a network analysis of crystalline materials.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Open Access&rdquo;, meaning I don&rsquo;t have to pay to read the text and figures. There was one figure that had neat
data-driven graphics for two separate materials, one stacked on top of the other.</p>
<p>I wondered what the graphics would look like for some of the other 22,600 materials considered
by the study. But there was nowhere to click or mouseover to get that party started. Of course not. But why not?</p>
<h2 id="linked-open-data">Linked open data</h2>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee presented a 5-star rating system for linked open data.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The figure I liked in the publication, a PNG image, counts as 1-star open data. It really is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a web app<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> was developed to explore the underlying data driving
the figure, but that doesn&rsquo;t have functionality to reproduce the figure. I mention it only as an example of 2-star
open data, in the sense that one could obtain some data from the app in a structured way using non-standard code to
automate browser actions, if one so chose.</p>
<p>The article also links to 3-star data. The data is obtained by downloading a zip file
containing a plaintext license file (CC-BY-4.0, great!), a CSV file, and two JSON files. This is good &ndash; all
non-proprietary formats. Three stars.</p>
<p>The data in the files don&rsquo;t use HTTP URIs to identify things.
This is not necessarily a big deal if specialists in a domain implicitly share
conventions/ontologies around naming things (including relationships) and expressing data values, but it
poses friction, especially for automated reuse.</p>
<p>For example, I may be pretty sure that the string key value
&ldquo;Mn3TeO6&rdquo; in the giant JSON object comprising one of the JSON files
is a reduced (unit cell) chemical formula for a specific known phase of a crystalline material, but I don&rsquo;t know.
With linked data, HTTP URIs are used as names for things so that people can look up those names. If the
key value was <code>&lt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10030-5/Mn3TeO6&gt;</code>, and I could query for metadata relating
to that resource (using open linked-data standards like RDF and SPARQL), then I could more confidently interpret the
data. This would be 4-star data.</p>
<p>Linking to other people&rsquo;s data to provide context, like setting that key to be
<a href="https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-18795"><code>&lt;https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-18795&gt;</code></a>, or at least
linking to it via an RDF property
like <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_seealso"><code>rdfs:seeAlso</code></a>, would make it 5-star data.</p>
<h2 id="representing-knowledge-with-computation">Representing knowledge with computation</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, even 5-star data doesn&rsquo;t get me my parameterized figure UI, which I want one click away from the static
figure embedded in the publication&rsquo;s online text. Not directly. Some application code needs to run. But, that
application code could be data-driven, and with 5-star data it could be <em>principally</em> data-driven. A data model with
ontology as a first-class citizen means there is no need for a &ldquo;convention over configuration&rdquo; stance: conventions
themselves become eminently configurable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, data-driven UI can be so seamless that there is no shuffling among, say, an IDE, a collection of Jupyter
notebooks, web apps, and document typesetting systems like LaTeX that deliver a published article.
The idea that people today are still <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/">trying to understand cancer by staring
at a text editor is appalling</a>.
Researchers need tools for What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) workflows, shareable with their peers and beyond.</p>

<![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>There is a lot of data out there that many of you can turn into information. Synthesizing the information into
knowledge takes experience and help. And utilizing knowledge until it’s innate wisdom it [<em>sic</em>] harder still.</p>
<p>— <cite>Alan Weiss</cite><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d like have a working mental model for this chain relating data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.
Weiss and Wilkerson define data, information, knowledge, and wisdom as follows<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data - units of statistics, numbers, words, and language that can be gathered and sorted.
<br><br>
Information - facts derived from data that can be verified and validated.
<br><br>
Knowledge - information combined with one’s talents that creates a grasp of subject matter, context, and
application.
<br><br>
Wisdom - information [<em>sic</em>] combined with judgement and experience to anticipate and apply solutions and make quality
decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is a helpful starting point for me, but it falls short in two ways. First, it unnecessarily complicates by
branching both knowledge and wisdom from information. This is why I included the &ldquo;[<em>sic</em>]&rdquo; above. Let&rsquo;s take it to
read that wisdom is <em>knowledge</em> combined with judgement and experience.</p>
<p>The second way the definitions above fall short is best expressed by Fong and Spivak&rsquo;s co-definition of data and
information<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data becomes information when it is stored <em>in</em> a given <em>formation</em>.
That is, the numbers and letters don’t mean anything until they are organized,
often into a system of interlocking tables.
An organized system of interlocking tables is called a database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, information is the &ldquo;gathered&rdquo; state of that which &ldquo;can be gathered&rdquo;. To turn information into
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; (which are not &ldquo;facts&rdquo; <em>until</em> they are &ldquo;verified and validated&rdquo;) is to apply a grasp of subject matter
and context.</p>
<p>I also see how information and knowledge can get complected<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, given common usage of the term &ldquo;informative&rdquo;.
In <em>The Goal</em>,<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> database analyst Ralph
draws a distinction between data and information that aligns
with Wilkerson and Weiss&rsquo; distinction one rung up the ladder, between information and knowledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I’m holding in my files is data. What you are usually asking for is information. I always regarded information
as those sections of the data which are needed in order to make a decision&hellip;What I started to realize is that
information is something else. Information is the answer to the question asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-structure-and-interpretation-of-data">The Structure and Interpretation of Data</h2>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve somewhat explicated the terms of the chain of data-information-knowledge-wisdom, I&rsquo;m ready to reify it
by way of analogy to the structure and interpretation of computer programs (not to the book itself,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> but
certainly to its contents!).</p>
<p>The road from data to information is akin to the traditional
decomposition of
discovering the structure of a program&rsquo;s text into two subtasks<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Split the source file into tokens (Lex).</li>
<li>Find the hierarchical structure of the program (Yacc).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Take, for instance, this simple source text: <code>[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</code>. A tokenizer could take that source and produce
this stream of tokens, of data:
<code>[</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>,</code> (the comma token), <code>3</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>5</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>7</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>9</code>, and finally <code>]</code>.
Then, a parser could take a pass at the token data, getting them <em>in formation</em>, interpreted as a list data
structure
with five numeric elements. In this way, data (tokens) sourced from text
are gathered in formation as the program&rsquo;s abstract syntax tree (AST).</p>
<p>How, now, to combine information, to &ldquo;grasp&rdquo; its context for application? How to go from information to knowledge?
The <em>environment model of evaluation</em> reifies the idea of context and its application to information<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The environment is crucial to the evaluation process, because it determines the context in which an expression should be evaluated. Indeed, one could say that expressions in a programming language do not, in themselves, have any meaning. Rather, an expression acquires a meaning only with respect to some environment in which it is evaluated. Even the interpretation of an expression as straightforward as (+ 1 1) depends on an understanding that one is operating in a context in which + is the symbol for addition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The environment model involves &ldquo;frames&rdquo; that each host a set of variable-value bindings, like a variable <code>x</code> being bound
to the numeric value <code>3</code>. Each frame may point to an enclosing (&ldquo;backup&rdquo;) frame. The evaluation process
follows a sequence of frames to find the appropriate value to give to a variable. The right value depends on the
current arrangement of frames and their contents, which changes as the program steps in and out of new local
frames of execution.</p>
<p>Philip Guo&rsquo;s Python Tutor<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> is a great tool to visualize the knowledge
structure of program execution, the evolving environment-frame structure and its application to information
(object data structure).</p>
<p>Stephen Wolfram also connects knowledge representation with computation. From his announcement of RDF
and SPARQL support
in the latest major release of Mathematica<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the best way to represent knowledge about the world? It’s an issue that’s been debated by philosophers (and others) since antiquity. Sometimes people said logic was the key. Sometimes mathematics. Sometimes relational databases. But now we at least know one solid foundation (or at least, I’m pretty sure we do): everything can be represented by computation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, where does <em>wisdom</em> fit in? It doesn&rsquo;t. It fits <em>out</em>, outside the program interpreter, guiding its execution.
Wisdom is embedded in the person who
assembles appropriate source data and program syntax <em>in formation</em> and runs it on a machine in a certain context.
Wisdom compiles in you.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I came across
<a href="https://www.dataopsmanifesto.org/">The DataOps Manifesto</a>,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
which states five values with regard to developing and delivering analytics. I was surprised that I disagreed with
all five.</p>
<h2 id="individuals-and-interactions-over-processes-and-tools">&ldquo;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Processes and tools are the foundation of effective analytics, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what the authors
meant by their use of the word &ldquo;over&rdquo;. Yes, of course, individuals and interactions inform the design of such
processes and tools, but the former are transient. People come and go. Interactions wax and wane.</p>
<p>This value hints at a certain charm around informality, but often an apparent lack of structure means only that the
structure is unknown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness">or perhaps denied</a>. Analytics
need structure if they are to track how structure (schema) evolves.</p>
<h2 id="working-analytics-over-comprehensive-documentation">&ldquo;Working analytics over comprehensive documentation&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Analytics need to work. However, ancillary support like documentation is the foundation for answering new questions
, questions not addressed
by what&rsquo;s merely at work <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the division of database systems into online transaction processing (OLTP) and
online analytical processing (OLAP). OLTP systems are the <em>working</em> systems, made to handle specific
questions (requests, transactions) quickly. OLAP systems, though also tuned to handle specific
aggregation-hungry questions, are there to answer new questions.</p>
<p>To emphasize a &ldquo;working&rdquo; system over support for infrequently-asked questions is to devalue the OLTP/OLAP
distinction.</p>
<h2 id="customer-collaboration-over-contract-negotiation">&ldquo;Customer collaboration over contract negotiation&rdquo;</h2>
<p>My disagreement with this relates to my take on the importance of processes and tools above. Collaboration how?
What does it look like?
Contracts materialize collaboration. In software development, they
often take names like
<em>interfaces</em>, <em>types</em>, <em>unit tests</em>, etc.</p>
<h2 id="experimentation-iteration-and-feedback-over-extensive-upfront-design">&ldquo;Experimentation, iteration, and feedback over extensive upfront design&rdquo;</h2>
<p>What is the thing with which you can experiment, iterate, and obtain feedback? An upfront design. At first I thought I
would need to call out &ldquo;extensive&rdquo; as a strawman, but I realize it&rsquo;s actually great for me here.</p>
<p><em>Extent</em> is the area
covered by something. An extensive design covers what you know there is to cover. What if you know very little about
the problem area upfront? Well then, your extensive design shouldn&rsquo;t take very long, and it will grow in extent as
you experiment, iterate, and get feedback. But materialize what you (claim to) know up front.</p>
<h2 id="cross-functional-ownership-of-operations-over-siloed-responsibilities">&ldquo;Cross-functional ownership of operations over siloed responsibilities&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Cross-functional use of resources is great, but I turn to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">single-responsibility principle</a>
when it comes to ownership, to responsibility. This dichotomy is analogous
to the second part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> acronym for software design
principles, namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle">open-closed principle</a>, where
an entity allows its behavior to be extended without allowing its modification.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Shoot for success, not perfection.</p>
<p>Success is the path of confidence. Perfection is the path of arrogance. If you&rsquo;ve
achieved perfection in something, by your estimation, there is nothing that can be improved upon, nothing to be learned.</p>
<p>This belief, that you have nothing more to learn, is the key difference between confidence and arrogance. With
confidence, you know your value, and that value is good enough by the metric that matters: success.</p>
<p>If you
succeed at something, that warrants confidence. You may still be able to learn more, to improve, to gain the
skill and capacity to deliver even more value next time, or in a situation where the bar is higher &ndash; where previously
you may have failed, but now you believe you will succeed.</p>
<p>Perfection means &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done learning,&rdquo; which is arrogance, and
will blind you to shifting winds and subtle (or not-so-suble) feedback. Your rate of success may then decline, while you
continue of course to be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t strive for perfection; strive for success.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>At my last full-time job, I had a performance evaluation each year with my supervisor.
The format was batch call-and-response.
First, I self-evaluated and filled out all sections. Then, my supervisor responded to my content. Finally, we met
briefly to go over the content before submitting to HR. In the last section of the evaluation,
I had listed my goals for the next year. This meant that, each year, my official performance goals for the following
year were determined this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wrote out a full draft proposal.</li>
<li>My supervisor read this and wrote comments.</li>
<li>We met briefly to discuss and conceptually agree to what was written.</li>
<li>The evaluation was sent to HR.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above process was mandated neither by my employer nor my supervisor. Rather, I
gradient-descended within some incentive landscape dimly visible to me. I &ldquo;defaulted&rdquo; to it.</p>
<p>My approach to setting performance goals was to go from a proposal to conceptual agreement. This is backwards
. Ideally, a proposal is &ldquo;merely a <em>summary of conceptual agreement</em> reached prior.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>How to accomplish this? There is no substitute for a sufficiently long, zero-distractions conversation. Schedule a
meeting. What is to be agreed upon?</p>
<ul>
<li>Outcomes. What&rsquo;s needed? Not deliverables, not inputs, not tasks.</li>
<li>Metrics. How will you know that progress is being made?</li>
<li>Value. The actual impact of the outcomes. Not enough? Back to outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conceptual agreement like this is crucial for value-based fees in consulting<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, for eschewing the &ldquo;default&rdquo; of
hourly rates.
However, it&rsquo;s also applicable to any professional relationship where you deliver value to someone. When is a
proposal
not a proposal, not an exploration, not a negotiation? When is a proposal actually a <em>summation</em>?
When you make it so.</p>
