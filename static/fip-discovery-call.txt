# FAIR-Enabling Resources

## Findable

- *Identifier service*: A service that provides for any digital object (1) algorithms guaranteeing
  global uniqueness, (2) a policy document that guarantees persistence, and (3) resolution of the
  identifier to machine-actionable metadata describing the object and its location.

- *Metadata schema*: A specification (schema) that specifies metadata fields describing attributes
  of data or other digital objects.

- *Metadata-data linking schema*: A specification (schema) that provides a unique, persistent,
  (ideally) bi-directional, machine-actionable link between metadata and the data they describe.

- *Registry*: A service that indexes metadata and data and provides search over that index.

## Accessible

- *Communication protocol*: A specification for how messages are structured and exchanged.

- *Authentication and authorization service*: A service that mediates access to digital objects
  according to specified conditions.

- *Metadata preservation policy*: A document that describes the conditions under which metadata are
  to be provisioned in the future (maybe part of a data management plan).

## Interoperable

- *Knowledge representation language*: A language specification whereby knowledge can be made
  processable by machines.

- *Structured vocabulary*: A controlled list of uniquely identified and unambiguous concepts with
  their definitions represented preferably using web standards.

- *Semantic model*: A specification that defines qualified relations between entities describing
  data or other digital objects using structured vocabularies.

## Reusable

- *Data usage license*: A document that describes the conditions under which a digital object can be
  legally used.

- *Provenance model*: A specification (schema) that specifies metadata fields describing the origin
  and lineage of data or other digital objects.
